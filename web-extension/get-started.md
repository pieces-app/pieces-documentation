## Updating

The Pieces Web Extension will automatically update when a new version is available.

This depends on how your browser handles extensions—most browsers automatically update extensions.

You can also manually update by visiting the extension's install page, uninstalling it, and then reinstalling the extension.

## Pieces Cloud

Disconnecting from the Pieces Cloud logs you out of your Pieces account.

Connecting to the Pieces Cloud is optional.

However, it provides additional features like data backups, shareable links, and more. You can still enjoy the main functionalities of Pieces without an account.

To disconnect from the Pieces Cloud:

Click the Pieces Icon in the extensions bar of your browser to open the Pieces Web Extension.

Select the sandwich menu icon in the top right of the Pieces extension. This will open up the Quick Settings menu.



In the new popup menu, select the settings gear icon.

Select the Sign Out button at the bottom of the section. This will only say Sign Out if you are logged in.



## Onboarding

The Pieces Web Extension features an interactive walkthrough that shows you the magic behind the Long Term Memory (LTM-2) and how to get the most out of the web extension.

Click Activate LTM, and the welcome page appears with an overview of LTM-2.

You'll have the option to close the page or click I'm In to continue. Click I'm In, and the magic window pops up with interactive features that guide you through the process.



Inside the magic window, click Generate Secret Message, and a browser window opens to display an example snippet for LTM. Y

ou'll be prompted to paste your copied prompt—“What was my secret message from Pieces for Developers?”—and then click Submit.



Once submitted, Pieces celebrates your activation, showing you that LTM-2 is enabled and ready to go!
