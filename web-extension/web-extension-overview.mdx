## Using Pieces Copilot

You can do many powerful things with Pieces Copilot in your browser, such as starting a conversation directly in the editor with your chosen LLM about a specific code snippet, fragment, folder, or terminal output.

This is the backbone of the Pieces Copilot experience—the **Ask Copilot** feature.

**Ask Copilot** allows you to [ask Pieces to explain what you're reading](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/copilot/chat#generative-ai-conversations), helping you better understand the content. It can also generate responses filled with context outside of just your browser by referencing workflow data captured by the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2).

## Managing Materials

When you save material to your personal repository, Pieces automatically enriches the snippet with AI-generated tags, titles, related authors, links, descriptions, and more.

Save materials by right-clicking a selection and choosing the `Save Selection` `to Pieces` option from the pop-up window.

In this menu, you’re also able to select `Ask Pieces About…` to ask Pieces about the current selection so you can start a conversation right when you come across something without context-switching.

### **Referencing & Reusing**

The Pieces Web Extension provides robust search tools to help you quickly find and access your saved materials.

You can easily find saved materials in your Web Extension by clicking the `Pieces` icon in your extensions list and switching to the Pieces Drive view.

At the top of the Pieces Drive, you can [search](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/search-reuse#finding-saved-materials), [filter](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/search-reuse#filtering-snippets), and [sort your materials](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/search-reuse#sorting-snippets) to find anything you’d like.

Once you've found the material you want, clicking on it will open it, giving you [options to manage it](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/edit-update). Pieces will also provide options to [share and copy.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/sharing)
