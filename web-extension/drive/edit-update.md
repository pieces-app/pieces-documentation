# Editing

Keep your code snippets up-to-date in the Pieces Web Extension with easy editing.

## How to Edit Saved Materials

Editing saved materials is a great way to make sure that your most-used code or reference text stays as evergreen as possible.

The more you curate your library of saved code snippets to your specific workflow and use cases, the more useful and “dialed in” your personal repository will be over time

To modify an existing snippet, follow these steps:

Click the Pieces icon in the extensions section of your browser.

Go to the Pieces Drive section of the browser by clicking the dropdown in the top left of the extension and selecting Pieces Drive.

At the bottom of the quick view section, click the Edit Selected Material button (pencil icon) to enter editing mode.

Modify the snippet's content, name, or language as needed.

Click the Save Changes button on the bottom left of the extension.



Within the editing view, you will also have options to 4 new options:

Templatize Selected Material: This will convert the material into a template for future usage inside your IDEs.

Optimize Selected Material for Performance: This option refactors the code for performance and future usage.

Optimize Select Material for Readability: Selecting this option will improve variable names and add helpful comments to make the code easier to understand in the future.

Convert Selected Material to New Language: This option converts the selected material to a new programming language and allows you to add custom descriptors to help improve the translation.

Your changes are automatically saved in real-time and reflected across the Pieces Sidebar.

There are several material management options available when editing code snippets in the Pieces Web Extension:
