## Install Pieces for Linux

Follow the steps below to download and install Pieces for Linux using the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

### Requirements

There are several requirements that your Linux device must meet to download and install the Pieces Desktop App, PiecesOS, and _ensure LTM-2 compatibility._

- **Snap Support:** Ensure `snapd` is installed and enabled on your system. Most recent Ubuntu releases include `snapd` by default. If needed, install `snapd` by following the official `snapd` documentation.
- **Administrator Access:** You’ll need `sudo` privileges to install `snap` packages.
- **Minimum OS Type:** PiecesOS has been tested and developed primarily for Ubuntu 22\+ or later-based distributions, so make sure your system is updated to at least Ubuntu 22\+ or later.
- **X11 Window Manager:** Virtual Linux machines or dedicated instances of Linux, even PiecesOS-compatible Ubuntu 22\+ distributions, _must utilize_ **X11** as the proprietary Window Manager.
- 

<Tip>
  To determine which display manager your Linux device is using, go to **Settings,** then **System,** and **System Details** to see if you are using an X11 or a non-LLVM compatible manager.
