## Get Started 

Integrating the Pieces MCP with Cursor is a **powerful** and **efficient** way to bring your daily workflow context directly into your IDE.

With this integration, you'll have an in-IDE chatbot that _knows more about your project_ than just the active file or project folder.

You can ask questions about additional workflow information, like whether a coworker fixed a bug in last week's PR, and then use that solution to fix a similar error in your code without having to look through old chat logs or GitHub commits.

Learn how to integrate the Pieces MCP into Cursor by following the steps below.

<Info>
  It is imperative that you download and/or update your version of Cursor to the **latest, most up-to-date version** to ensure compatibility with Pieces MCP.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

There are **[2]** primary prerequisites for integrating Pieces with Cursor as an MCP—an active instance of **PiecesOS** and the fully-enabled **Long-Term Memory** engine.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install & Run PiecesOS">
    Make sure that PiecesOS is installed and running. This is _required_ for the MCP server to communicate with your personal repository of workflow data and pass context through to the Cursor chat agent.

    If you do not have PiecesOS, you can download it alongside the [Pieces Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/download) or [install it standalone](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#manual-download--installation) here.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Long-Term Memory">
    For the MCP server to interact with your workflow context, you must enable the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) through the Pieces Desktop App or the [PiecesOS Quick Menu](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu) in your toolbar.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installing PiecesOS & Configuring Permissions

Follow the instructions below for a detailed guide on setting up and configuring PiecesOS to correctly pass captured workflow context to the Pieces MCP server.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    **Installing PiecesOS for macOS**

    [Download the standalone PiecesOS file](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#macos) for your macOS system’s ARM or Intel-based architecture to start the installation process.

    _Your device must be updated to macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or higher._

    1. Download the correct PiecesOS file for your system’s architecture.
    2. From your **Downloads** folder, double-click the installed PiecesOS file to open it.
    3. Drag PiecesOS into the application folder if prompted, then open PiecesOS.

    **Configuring Permissions**

    There are two permissions prompts that will pop up on your screen when installing PiecesOS.

    > _PiecesOS is an app downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it?_

    Click `Open` to continue with the installation.

    Then, you’ll see a second permissions pop-up message:

    > PiecesOS is requesting to bypass the system private window picker and directly access your screen and audio. This will allow PiecesOS to record your screen and system audio, including personal or sensitive information that may be visible or audible.

    Click `Allow`.

    These permissions are required for [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to power the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) and, in turn, capture context from your workflow to provide information to the [Pieces MCP server.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started)

    PiecesOS will automatically open in your toolbar and pop up a _Notification preferences modal_ in the upper right corner of your screen.

    **Enabling the LTM-2 Engine**

    For the Pieces MCP to function, Long-Term Memory must be enabled.

    To do this, open up the PiecesOS Quick Menu and click `Enable Long-Term Memory Engine`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **Installing PiecesOS for Windows**

    [Download the standalone PiecesOS file](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/manual-installation#windows) for your Windows machine to start the installation process.

    _Your device must be updated to Windows 10 (20HO) or higher._

    1. Download the file.
    2. From your **Downloads** folder, double-click the installed PiecesOS file to open it.
    3. Click `Yes` when the _User Account Control_ modal pops up on your screen to proceed with the installation.

    **Note:** Some users who have enabled Controlled Folder Access (CFA) as a security measure may receive a notification that Pieces is attempting to bypass this security wall.

    PiecesOS uses vision processing to ingest context from foreground applications horizontally. To decide which apps PiecesOS has access to, you can [easily enable and disable specific sources](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control) from the Long-Term Memory Access Control panel.

    4. Choose your installation location and click `Next`.
    5. Click `Install`, then `Finish` when the progress bar has finished loading.
    6. Follow the installer’s instructions, selecting a download location and preferred file path as necessary.

    PiecesOS will launch when the installation process is completed, and can be found in your Windows _System Tray_ at the bottom left corner of your screen.

    **Enabling the LTM-2 Engine**

    For the Pieces MCP to function, Long-Term Memory must be enabled.

    To do this, open up the PiecesOS Quick Menu and click `Enable Long-Term Memory Engine`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    **Installing PiecesOS for Linux**

    To download and install PiecesOS _and_ utilize the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) on your Linux device, you must meet **(4)** requirements.

    - **Snap Support:** Ensure `snapd` is installed and enabled on your system. Most recent Ubuntu releases include `snapd` by default. If needed, install `snapd` by following the official `snapd` documentation.
    - **Administrator Access:** You’ll need `sudo` privileges to install `snap` packages.
    - **Minimum OS Type:** PiecesOS has been tested and developed primarily for Ubuntu 22\+ or later-based distributions, so make sure your system is updated to at least Ubuntu 22\+ or later.
    - **X11 Window Manager:** Virtual Linux machines or dedicated instances of Linux, even PiecesOS-compatible Ubuntu 22\+ distributions, _must utilize_ **X11** as the proprietary Window Manager. To determine which display manager your Linux device is using, go to **Settings,** then **System,** and **System Details** to see if you are using an X11 or a non-LLVM compatible manager.

    **_Note:_** _Ubuntu 22\+ using the X11 Window Manager is required_ to install PiecesOS and use LTM.

    Run these commands **to install and set up PiecesOS properly**.

    1. Open the Command-Line Interface (CLI) using the `ctrl+alt+t` keyboard shortcut.
    2. Run `sudo snap install pieces-os` to install PiecesOS. You will be prompted to enter your local account’s password.
    3. Enter and run `sudo snap connect pieces-os:process-control :process-control` to enable offline and on-device machine learning and large language model (LLM) functionality.

    **Note:** Make sure to run the above permissions-related commands. These are required for the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) to capture context from your workflow to serve the [Pieces MCP](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started).

    To launch PiecesOS, type `pieces-os` in your terminal and press `enter`.

### Getting the SSE Endpoint for PiecesOS

To use Pieces MCP with Cursor, you'll first need the Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint from PiecesOS:

```markdown
http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse
```

<Warning>
  Keep in mind that the **specific port** (i.e., `39300`) PiecesOS is running on **may vary**.
</Warning>

To find the current SSE endpoint with the active instance of POS (including the current port number), open the PiecesOS Quick Menu and expand the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** tab.

There, you can click once to copy the SSE endpoint, which includes the active PiecesOS port number.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_pos_new.png)

You can also do this in the Pieces Desktop App by opening the **Settings** view and clicking **Model Context Protocol (MCP).**

### via Global MCP Configuration

To set up the Pieces MCP, you can edit the `.json` settings configuration file from within **Cursor Settings.**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Cursor Settings**, then to the `MCP` section.

    ![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_no_mcp.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New MCP">
    Add a new global MCP server by clicking `Add new global MCP server` and inserting the following `.json` snippet (adjust port if necessary) in the `.json` file that opens:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Pieces": {
          "url": "http://localhost:39300/model_context_protocol/2024-11-05/sse"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the File">
    Save the configuration file.

    Make sure to refresh the MCP server window by clicking the **refresh icon** and ensure that there is a _green dot_ indicating that the server is running and functioning without errors.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Pieces MCP">
    Once the MCP server is set up, make sure to change the chat mode to _Agent_ mode. This should automatically utilize the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Pieces MCP Server in Cursor

Once integrated, you can utilize [Pieces LTM](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) directly in Cursor through the built-in chat agent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Chat Panel">
    Open the right-hand chat panel by toggling it at the top-right corner, or use the shortcut `⌘+i` (macOS) or `ctrl+i` (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Cursor Agent'">
    Make sure that you are using the _Cursor Agent_ mode, not _Ask_ or _Manual._ This is required to use the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool to access context from LTM.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin Prompting">
    From this point, you can begin prompting. If PiecesOS was previously installed, try testing out the Pieces MCP integration with a prompt like, "What was I doing for work yesterday?" and click `Use Tool` when prompted.

### Configuring Rules

If you want to customize the specific output provided by the Cursor chatbot through working with the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool, you can manually adjust the _rules_ for inside of **Cursor Settings.**

To do this, open up **Cursor Settings,** click `Rules`, then add new _User Rules._

Here's an example of a straightforward set of rules tailored to a specific use case and work flow:

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues integrating Pieces MCP with Cursor, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify PiecesOS Status**: Ensure [PiecesOS is actively running](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/troubleshooting) on your system. MCP integration requires PiecesOS to be operational.
2. **Confirm LTM Engine Activation**: Make sure the [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) is enabled in PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#ltm-2-engine), as this engine aggregates context necessary for Cursor to retrieve accurate results.
3. **Single MCP Instance:** Make sure that you aren't testing multiple instances of the Pieces MCP server in different IDEs. This cross-contamination conflict with the SSE and several MCP instances running on the same port can cause issues in different development environments.
4. **Use Agent Mode in Chat**: Cursor must be in _Agent Mode_, not _Ask Mode_, to access the `ask_pieces_ltm` tool. Switch to Agent Mode to enable full MCP integration.
5. **Turn Off Auto-Select**: If Cursor is having issues finding the Pieces tool, de-select `auto-select` and select an individual Agent, such as `claude-3.5-sonnet`.
6. **Check MCP Server Status**: If you're encountering messages such as "Sorry, I can't do this," your MCP server may not be properly configured or running.
7. **Go to** `settings.json` **in Cursor:** Confirm the MCP server status shows "running" (it may say "start" or "pause" otherwise). Restart the server if necessary and inspect terminal outputs for error messages.
8. **Review Configuration Details**: Double-check the MCP endpoint URL and the port number in Cursor settings to ensure accuracy, You can find the current SSE endpoint URL in the Pieces Desktop App under **Settings** → **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, or in the PiecesOS Quick Menu. It is usually formatted as:

```scss
http://localhost:{port_number}/model_context_protocol/{version}/sse
```

### JSON Blob Error in MCP Settings

When you open **Preferences → Settings → MCP**, you may see a raw `.JSON` payload or _"unknown message ID"_ error displayed beneath your enabled Pieces server—even though your tool calls work correctly.

Cursor's _Settings_ UI currently doesn't recognize the JSON-RPC success envelope, so it misclassifies the response as an error object and dumps the payload.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/mcp_documentation/mcp_cursor/cursor_error.png)

This visual artifact is harmless. All genuine LTM responses still arrive properly in the Cursor chat window.

<Warning>
  Ignore any red `.JSON` blobs in the MCP Settings view. The **Chat** pane is the source of truth—if your pieces queries return formatted summaries there, the integration is functioning normally.
</Warning>
