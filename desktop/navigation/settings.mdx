You can customize the Pieces Desktop App to your coding workflow by integrating external services or customizing the interface.

### Account & Integrations

In this section, you can integrate external services with Pieces and adjust your user details, beginning with [Account Information](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/account-and-cloud#account-management).

This area displays your email address and any linked accounts.

### Personal Cloud

The [Personal Cloud](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/account-and-cloud#disconnecting-personal-cloud) tab controls how your snippets and materials sync across devices.

You’ll see a status for your cloud connection (including the last sync time), plus options to set or modify your personal domain.

There’s also a **Backup & Restore Data** feature to preserve or retrieve your snippets from the cloud whenever needed.

- **Status**: Check if your cloud is connected and see when it last synced.
- **Domain**: Update your personal domain.
- **Backup & Restore Data**: Protect your snippets and data.

### Copilot Chats

Within [Pieces Copilot Chats](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/copilot-and-machine-learning#copilot-chats), decide which LLM runtime powers the Pieces Copilot and manage your chat-specific settings.

![Copilot Chats](https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/desktop_app_assets/settings_with_mcp_update/navigation_then_settings/copilot_chats.png)

You can:

- **Manage Copilot LLM Runtime**: Switch or reset your current LLM.
- **Hard-Reset Active Runtime**: Restart the runtime if it becomes unresponsive.
- **Accent Color**: Pick a color for the chat UI.
- **Delete All Copilot Chats**: Clear your chat history.

### Machine Learning

Pieces uses an on-device ML engine (with optional cloud capabilities) to enrich and tag your snippets.

Inside the [Machine Learning](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/copilot-and-machine-learning#machine-learning) tab, you can toggle:

- **Auto-Generated Tags**
- **Auto-Generated Websites**
- **Auto-Generated Hints**
- **Auto-Generated People**

Adjust the **Enrichment Level** (0 to 9) or choose an **Enrichment Mode** (local, cloud, or blended). The Long-Term Memory engine captures historical data for additional context—if needed, you can clear it to start fresh.

### Views & Layouts

[Views & Layouts](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/aesthetics-layout#adjusting-layout) controls how you see content in Pieces.

You can set a **Default Layout**, choose how items are sorted in list or gallery views, and select a **Default Search Mode** like **Neural Code Search (NCS)**.

You’ll also find options for **Confirmation Settings** (for specific actions), toggles for usage or metrics summaries, and a **Default Toolbar** for newly saved snippets.

### Aesthetics

Switch between **Light** or **Dark** mode, select an **Accent Color** for UI highlights, and use the **Zoom In/Out** controls to adjust the interface scale.

These settings help you create a comfortable coding environment for extended sessions.
