## Overview

The Captured Context view in Pieces for Developers uses the Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) to automatically gather, categorize, and display details from your coding workflow—such as websites, file anchors, people, annotations, and tags.

## Accessing the Captured Context View

To open the **Power Menu**, click the `Home Icon` next to the search bar in the Pieces Desktop App, or press `⌘+return` (macOS) or `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux).

Then select `Captured Context` from the dropdown.

When you first open the _Captured Context_ view, you’ll see a list of recently captured websites:

Each entry typically includes a snapshot image, a page title slug, a short description generated by Pieces Copilot, and a clickable URL.

## Navigation & Actions

A series of tabs appears above the list—**websites**, **anchors**, **people**, **annotations**, and **tags**—along with a search bar.

These tabs let you switch between different categories of captured context, while the search bar instantly filters your repository based on any keywords you enter.

### Websites

Under _websites_, you’ll see pages that the LTM detected during your workflow.

Each entry usually includes a thumbnail or banner image, a short description, and a direct link to the site.

Clicking the link opens the webpage in your browser.

### Anchors

The **Anchors** tab displays context tied to specific files or folders you’ve accessed, such as project directories, code bases, and locations where snippets are stored.

This is especially helpful for recalling exactly where certain references or snippets live in your projects.

### People

Under **People**, you’ll see names, email addresses, or organization members that the LTM captured during your workflow—which is great when multiple contributors are involved in a particular task.

### Annotations

The **Annotations** tab provides AI-generated short descriptions for your snippets or other saved materials.

These concise overviews allow you to recall a snippet’s purpose without opening the entire material, keeping your workspace uncluttered.

### Tags

Within **Tags**, you’ll find automatically generated descriptors that highlight the frameworks, languages, or key concepts that are continually referenced in your workflow.

Scanning these tags makes it easy to locate related items or filter your collection based on a specific technology or theme.

You can also add your own tags, too—just click the `Add Tags` button in the bottom right of the Pieces Desktop App.
