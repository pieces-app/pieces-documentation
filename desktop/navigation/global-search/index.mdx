## Accessing Global Search

**Global Search** is a universal search query feature that helps you find anything that has been captured, tracked, or saved to your Pieces Drive.

Scanning all stored content delivers quick, context-rich results that help you locate and utilize your materials more efficiently.

Here’s how to open **Global Search**:

1. Open the **Power Menu** by clicking the `Home Icon` next to the search bar in the Pieces Desktop App, or press `⌘+return` (macOS) or `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux).

2. In the *Find Action* field, type **Global Search**.

3. Select `Go to Global Search` from the dropdown.

## Main Interface Overview

When **Global Search** first opens, you’ll see:

* A *Find Materials...* search bar at the top.

* A *Suggested Searches* section under the search bar.

* A `Refresh` icon next to Suggested Searches to get a new set of recommendations.

* A ‘Powered by NCS’ indicator and an `i` icon at the bottom, which explains more about NCS when hovered over.

### Suggested Searches

Below the search bar, you’ll find a list of *Suggested Searches* based on your recent activity or frequently accessed snippets.

To use this feature, either click a *Suggested Search* to immediately run that query, or click the `Refresh` icon to load a new set of suggestions.
