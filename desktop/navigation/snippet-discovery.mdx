## Features

This feature lets you utilize Pieces to research and scan local code repositories for useful code snippets. Once found, they can be saved directly to your Pieces Drive.

### Drag & Drop Files or Folders

On the **Snippet Discovery** page, a large drag-and-drop area awaits your files or folders.

Simply drop your code files or an entire folder, and Pieces will begin scanning them for snippets.

### Discovering Snippets

After your files or folders are uploaded, Pieces scans them for potential code snippets.

You’ll see a _“We discovered X snippets”_ screen, where `X` is the total number of snippets found.

Three actions appear at the top-right:

- `Start Over`: Resets the view, allowing you to drag in a new file or folder.
- `Select All`: Toggles all snippets to be selected or deselected at once.
- `Save All`: Saves every discovered snippet in a single action. Once you click it, a loading indicator shows progress (e.g., _Adding 18 of 26_).

### Selecting and Saving Snippets

Each snippet shows a `+` sign by default.

Click `Select All` to change every `+` to a `-`, which means all snippets are ready to be saved. If you only want certain snippets, click the `+` next to each one you want to include.

When you’re ready, the button at the top-right displays a `Save All` message if all snippets are selected, or `Save # of Selected Snippets` if only some are chosen.

As each snippet saves successfully, you’ll see a small green check mark in its bottom-right corner.

### Partial Saves & Continuing

You don’t have to save every snippet immediately.

Feel free to save a subset of snippets (e.g., `Save X Snippets`), leave others for later, or select more as you go.

If you decide to start fresh with a different file or folder, click `Start Over` to discard the current session.

## Exiting Snippet Discovery

Click the `Back Arrow` in the top-left corner to leave the Snippet Discovery page.

A prompt appears to confirm whether you want to exit without saving additional snippets or return to finish saving them.

You can also click `esc` (macOS/Windows/Linux).
