## Accessing Global Search

**Global Search** is a universal search query feature that helps you find anything that has been captured, tracked, or saved to your Pieces Drive.

Scanning all stored content delivers quick, context-rich results that help you locate and utilize your materials more efficiently.

Here’s how to open **Global Search**:

1. Open the **Power Menu** by clicking the `Home Icon` next to the search bar in the Pieces Desktop App, or press `⌘+return` (macOS) or `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux).
2. In the _Find Action_ field, type **Global Search**.
3. Select `Go to Global Search` from the dropdown.

## Main Interface Overview

When **Global Search** first opens, you’ll see:

- A _Find Materials..._ search bar at the top.
- A _Suggested Searches_ section under the search bar.
- A `Refresh` icon next to Suggested Searches to get a new set of recommendations.
- A ‘Powered by NCS’ indicator and an `i` icon at the bottom, which explains more about NCS when hovered over.

### Suggested Searches

Below the search bar, you’ll find a list of _Suggested Searches_ based on your recent activity or frequently accessed snippets.

To use this feature, either click a _Suggested Search_ to immediately run that query, or click the `Refresh` icon to load a new set of suggestions.

### Performing a Search

To perform a search, type your query into the _Find Materials_ field, then press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux), or you can click the `Search` icon.

Pieces will perform the search and display your results in the main view, sorted by how relevant they are to your query.

## Search Results

Once you run a search, **Global Search** populates the main area with matching snippets and related info.

Results are split into two sections, showing the list of located code snippets, materials, and other related context.
