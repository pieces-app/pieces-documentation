### via Power Menu — Find Action

From within the Power Menu, there is a search bar titled _Find Action_.

From this menu, you can either click or scroll through some of the available options, like `Manage General Copilot Settings`, `New General Copilot Conversation`, or `Refresh Selected Chat`.

These actions, some of which are view-specific—like refreshing a selected Pieces Copilot Chat—are useful ways to navigate throughout the Pieces Desktop App while maintaining speed and efficiency in your workflow.
