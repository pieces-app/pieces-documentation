## Accessing Workflow Activity

You can open the **Workflow Activity** page in several ways.

One approach is through the **Power Menu**—click the **Home** icon next to the search bar in the Pieces Desktop App, then select `Go to Workflow Activity`.

You can also press `⌘+return` (macOS) or `ctrl+enter` (Windows/Linux) to open the Power Menu, and choose `Workflow Activity` from the dropdown.

If you prefer a direct keyboard shortcut, use `⌘+shift+a` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+a` (Windows/Linux) to jump straight to the **Workflow Activity** page.

## Main View

Once opened, you’ll see a timeline of chronological events as they relate to your **Pieces Drive** usage.

Each entry shows key details, such as the snippet name, the event type (created, updated, deleted, or referenced), and a timestamp.

A `Show: (All)` dropdown appears at the top, allowing you to filter using several _events:_ `created`, `updated`, `deleted`, or `referenced`.

A `Refresh` button in the corner lets you reload the page to fetch the latest events, and a `Back` button returns you to the previous view.

## Searching for Events

At the top of the page, a search bar labeled _Find an Event_ enables you to quickly locate specific items in your timeline.

As you type a query, the list filters in real time, displaying only events that match your search.

## Right-Side Panels

To the right of the main activity list, you’ll find two panels—**Recent Searches** and **Top Materials.**

### Recent Searches

This panel shows your most recent event queries.

Hovering over a search term reveals options to `Search in Global Search`, `Copy Query`, or `Remove` the query from the list.

Clicking a recent search will also automatically initiate a global snippet search for that term.

### Top Materials

Here, Pieces displays your most frequently used or highest-ranked snippets, measured by _Productivity Points._

Each snippet is accompanied by an icon and a productivity score (e.g., 113 points). Hovering over the productivity score icon reveals the exact number of points.

### Productivity Points

A small `i` icon near the **Top Materials** heading provides an explanation of how _Productivity Points_ are calculated.

Pieces uses a _heuristics-based system_ to determine how often and in what ways a snippet is used, with higher scores indicating saved code materials that may be particularly useful given the task at hand.

## Opening Snippets

When you click on a snippet in **Top Materials** or in the main **Workflow Activity** list, Pieces immediately opens the Snippet View for that saved material.

Additionally, accessing any snippet triggers a new `Referenced` event in your timeline, confirming that you revisited or used that snippet.
