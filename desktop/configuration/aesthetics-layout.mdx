## Accessing Settings

When opening the Pieces Desktop App, click the `settings gear` at the bottom left of the default view to open the Views & Layouts and Aesthetics settings.

Then, navigate to either of the two sections:

1. **Views & Layouts**: Manage the layout of the Pieces Desktop app to customize it according to your preferences.

2. **Aesthetics**: Change the Pieces App's brightness, colors, and zoom level to ensure you're comfortable using it.

## Changing Theme

Pieces allows users to toggle between *dark mode* and *light mode*, giving you complete control over the appearance of the Pieces Desktop App.

### Dark & Light Mode

In the **Aesthetics** settings section, you can click the `Toggle Mode` button to switch between light and dark UI themes.

You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `⌘+shift+t` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+t` (Windows/Linux).

### Changing the Accent Color

Users can customize the UI with one of 35 preset accent colors.

Click the `Accent Color` dropdown in the **Aesthetics** settings section, select one of the available preset colors, and the accent color will apply to interactive elements like buttons and highlights, but not to the entire UI.

### Font & UI Size

Use the `Font Size` setting to adjust the size of all text.

\`To zoom in, use `⌘+,+` (macOS) or `ctrl+,+` (Windows/Linux)—to zoom out, use `⌘+,-` (macOS) or `ctrl+,-` (Windows/Linux).

## Adjusting Layout

There are several default layout behaviors to adjust within the **Views & Layouts** page.

  Theme changes are automatically saved when adjusted, and settings are stored locally, not synced with Pieces Cloud.
</Callout>

### Default Layout

In this section, you can select the `Default Layout` option to determine which interface appears when Pieces Desktop first launches.

For example, setting it to Pieces Copilot allows you to start with the default generative AI interface, whereas Pieces Drive sets the default interface to the saved materials view on application launch.

### Default List View Sort

In this section, the `Default List View Sort` option lets you arrange materials in *List View* based on `Recent`, `Suggested`, or `Alphabetical`, and `Language` criteria.

This default sorting ensures you see new or popular items first (or in whichever order best suits your workflow), without needing to manually re-sort each time.

### Default Gallery View Sort

The **Views & Layout** settings also include `Default Gallery View Sort`, allowing you to specify how items appear in *Gallery View* (e.g., sorted by `Most Recent` or `Alphabetical`).

If you frequently rely on visual cues, this setting ensures you’ll quickly spot the snippets or media you need, saving time on manual sorting.

### Default Search Mode

You can pick `Default Search Mode` to define which search method Pieces uses by default.

For instance, selecting Neural Code Search (NCS) lets you enter natural language queries—perfect for quickly finding code snippets or references without remembering exact filenames or tags.

This is opposed to *Full-Text Search (FTS)* or *Search with Snippet*, which are more specific, hyper-focused querying workflows.

### Confirmation Settings

Confirmation prompts can protect you from unintended deletions or other irreversible changes.

Enabling or adjusting `Confirmation Settings` determines whether Pieces requests an extra step (such as “Are you sure?”) before making significant modifications.

### Metrics Summary Settings

Each setting in the **Metrics Summary** settings view addresses a distinct scenario or user action within *Pieces Drive*.

Under the *Gallery View*, for instance, `Smart Layout` automatically displays the context summary for smaller snippets, while `All` shows summaries whenever you navigate or hover over snippet icons.

The `Navigating` option triggers summaries only when you scroll or switch between snippets in the *Gallery View*, and `Hovering` keeps them hidden until you hover over the context icon.

Mixing and matching these options allows you to highlight crucial snippet details precisely when needed.
