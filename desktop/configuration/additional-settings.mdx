## Accessing Settings

To access the general **Settings** view, navigate to the `Home Icon`, type _“settings,”_ and click Go to Settings. Alternatively, you can click the `Settings` gear in the bottom-left corner of the _default view._

## Telemetry & Diagnostics

You can control whether or not Pieces collects crash data and anonymous usage information. The Pieces team uses this information to help fix bugs and improve the app.

To enable or disable **Telemetry,** check or uncheck the `Tickbox` to the right of the **Telemetry** setting.

<tip>
  Participating in telemetry helps Pieces evolve more effectively, but you can opt out for greater privacy.

## Notification Preferences

Avoid unnecessary interruptions by customizing how and when you receive in-app alerts.

You can select the `Bell` icon under _Notifications_ to enable `All`, `Critical`, or `None` to determine how many—and what type—of notifications you receive.

`Critical` notifications are regarded primarily as errors and alerts—i.e., if PiecesOS is not detected (an edge case).
