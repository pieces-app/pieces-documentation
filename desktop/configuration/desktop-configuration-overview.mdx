### Model Content Protocol (MCP)

From this view, you can access the [_HTTP Server URL for the Pieces MCP._](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/configuration/mcp) This allows you to set up productivity tools and code editors that support this protocol with context directly from your local Pieces database.

You'll also find a _Book_ icon that links you to documentation on getting started with the Pieces MCP and information about available integrations.
