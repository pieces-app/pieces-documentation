### MCP Server URLs

In the MCP Settings, you'll find the **Server URLs** section.

This URL is what your development tools or AI applications, such as [Cursor](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/cursor) or [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/github-copilot), will use to communicate directly with your local PiecesOS MCP server.

You can copy this URL by clicking the _copy_ icon next to the URL text box and use it to configure integrations in compatible IDEs and code editors.

### MCP Server Version

The version displayed under the server URL indicates the currently running MCP protocol version.

Ensure your [tools and integrations](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started#getting-started) are compatible with this version to maintain smooth communication.

### View MCP Documentation

Click `View Documentation` to access detailed guides that explain how to leverage MCP integrations with popular development environments, such as Cursor and GitHub Copilot.

This documentation covers setup instructions, example scenarios, and troubleshooting tips for efficient MCP usage.

Here are quick examples of how MCP enhances your coding and debugging experiences:

- **Context-Rich Debugging**: Instantly retrieve logs, historical debugging notes, or team discussions directly from PiecesOS when troubleshooting within Cursor.
- **Contextual Queries**: Access historical code implementations, error resolutions, or previously encountered bugs within GitHub Copilot for quicker coding solutions.
