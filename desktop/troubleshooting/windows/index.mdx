## Issues Launching PiecesOS

Some users who have enabled Controlled Folder Access (CFA) as a security measure may receive a notification that Pieces is attempting to bypass this security wall.

To work around this issue, you will need to *add the executable path for PiecesOS* to your allowlist.

<Callout type="alert">
  The reason PiecesOS fails to launch when CFA is enabled is that the executable path for the PiecesOS application writes data to your Documents folder.

  CFA disables and blocks any request to modify files (in this case, writing & saving data), so PiecesOS is unable to launch itself.
</Callout>

Keep in mind that this path references the specific PiecesOS version, and so will change over time as long as you continue to update the software. You can also disable CFA as a security measure if you do not require it as part of an enterprise scenario or for any other reason.

PiecesOS uses vision processing to ingest context from foreground applications horizontally.

To decide which apps PiecesOS has access to, you can [easily enable and disable specific sources from the Long-Term Memory Access Control](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control) panel.

## Checking Hardware Specifications

You may need to check your system's specifications if you continue to experience issue[s, especially when trying to use local LLM](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control)s.

To check your device specifications on Windows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Windows search">
    Press the `Windows` key on your keyboard or the `Windows Icon` in the task bar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Run">
    Type **“run”** and press `enter`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Dxdiag">
    Type `dxdiag` and press `enter` or click the blue `OK` button.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The **System** tab displays your processor, the number of CPU cores, and memory (RAM), while the **Display** tab lists your GPU, its manufacturer (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, Intel), and the available video memory (VRAM).

### Checking Windows Version

If the Pieces Installer isn't working properly, you might be using an outdated version of Windows. Pieces requires at least **Windows 10 20H0 or higher**.

To find out your Windows version, press the `Windows` and `R` keys together, type **winver** in the pop-up window, and press `Enter`.

A new window will open called *About Windows*, which will display your current Windows version.

<Callout type="tip">
  If this doesn't work, you’re likely using a Windows version lower than Windows 10.
</Callout>

### Restart the Pieces Desktop App

After trying any of the fixes above, it’s recommended that you restart your desktop and the Pieces Desktop App.

This ensures all caches are clean and the computer is refreshed.
