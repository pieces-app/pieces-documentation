## What is Pieces Drive?

**Pieces Drive** is a central feature of the Pieces for Developers Desktop App—your all-in-one workspace for saving, managing, and quickly accessing code snippets and other development materials. 

## Overview

Pieces Drive gives you the tools to collect and access your most valuable development assets—code snippets, notes, and more—all in one integrated interface.

You can quickly add items, enrich them with tags and annotations, search using natural language or filters, transform snippets into different languages, and share links with others.

Below are quick overviews of Pieces Drive's features. For detailed information on a specific function, click the links for documentation and walkthroughs:

- [Saving & Organizing](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/save-and-organize): Learn how to add new materials, import existing code from local files or GitHub Gists, and keep your snippets neatly structured.


- [Searching & Filtering](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/search-and-filter): Discover how to leverage natural language queries, filters, and tags to quickly locate specific materials in Pieces Drive.
- [Enrichment & Metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/enrichment-and-metadata): Understand how Pieces automatically generates tags, annotations, suggested links, and captures context for each snippet, as well has how to access and update associated metadata.
- [Transforming Code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/transforming-code): See how you can duplicate code snippets to create more readable, more performant, or entirely different-language versions.
- [Sharing:](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive/sharing) Find out how to generate shareable links to your snippets, including managing sensitive information before sending links to colleagues.

<tip>
  Did you know that you can use _all of the data_ captured by LTM, stored inside your Pieces Drive, as context for Pieces Copilot Chats? [Read more here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/copilot-with-context)

## Pieces Drive | Main View

To access the Pieces Drive view, first click the _home_ icon in the top-left corner to open the [Power Menu.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/actions/power-menu)

Then, select `Pieces Drive` from the list of available views.

Inside the Pieces Drive view, you can:

1. Scroll through list of saved materials, or search using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find the materials you need.
2. Save new materials or create materials from scratch using a range of mediums.
3. View captured context alongside individual snippets and edit the metadata generated alongside them.
4. Discover related snippets, duplicate and transform snippets, or start [Pieces Copilot Chats with them.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/copilot/integration#enriching-chats-with-ltm-2-context)

By incorporating Pieces Drive into your workflow, you can stay both efficient and organization whether you’re working in a solo capacity or as part of a larger team.

### Saving & Organizing

We’ll walk you through the main Pieces Drive saving workflow and touch on all the essential elements you can interact with here.

You’ll learn how to add materials in various ways—pasting code from your clipboard, using an IDE plugin, importing GitHub Gists, or even discovering snippets in a local folder.

Or, you can create from scratch when you need a quick note or brand-new snippet and organize your growing library with tags, annotations, and reclassification.

### Searching & Filtering

One of Pieces Drive’s major advantages is its robust search capabilities.

By typing natural language queries or toggling filters for titles, annotations, or full snippet content, you can zero in on exactly what you need—even if you have hundreds of stored snippets.

In this section, we’ll cover how to use natural language to find snippets by function or topic, use filters to narrow down results by language, tags or custom phrases, and save specific search filters for repeated use.

### Enrichment & Metadata

Pieces Drive automatically enriches every snippet with valuable context, making it more than just a code vault.

This includes auto-generated titles, suggested queries, related websites, and tags that help you quickly see what a snippet does and how it might be used.

You’ll learn how to access _Captured Context_ for individual saved materials, how to manage sensitive information, view and edit automatically generated annotations and tags, and more.

### Transforming Code

Ever need a quick performance boost, a language switch, or a stripped-down boilerplate version of a saved code snippet?

Pieces Drive’s transformation options let you duplicate snippets in a few clicks to generate more readable or performance enhanced versions, snippets in different languages, and more.

### Sharing

Collaboration often requires easily accessible code references.

Pieces Drive allows you to create secure, shareable links for your snippets—complete with the same metadata and context found in your desktop app.

Learn how to generate shareable links with best practices in mind for handling sensitive data, and both internal and external use cases for sharing code.

### Integrating Pieces Drive & Pieces Copilot

When you want AI-assisted code explanations, troubleshooting, or generation, Pieces Copilot can reference the snippets you have saved in Pieces Drive.

By adding a snippet as context in a Copilot chat, the AI can read its entire content and produce more relevant, targeted answers.

We’ll show you how to attach snippets directly from Pieces Drive into a Pieces Copilot Chat, how to navigate back and forth between different views and help you understand how snippet metadata informs AI responses.
