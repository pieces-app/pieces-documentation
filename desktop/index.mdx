## Using the Desktop App

The Pieces Desktop app is designed to act as a *hub* for the three main features of the Pieces Suite, some of which can be found within Pieces extensions and plugins and PiecesOS—the **LTM-2 Engine, Pieces Copilot, and Pieces Drive.**

With the Pieces Desktop App, you have access to dedicated views for the context captured by Long-Term Memory and the new Workstream Activity feature, Pieces Copilot, and Pieces Drive.

If you know what you’re after, jump to our [documentation on the different navigation views.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/navigation)

## Core Features

There are three core components of Pieces that are intelligently integrated to minimize context switching and improve productivity in your daily workflow.

### LTM & Workstream Activity

Keep track of your workflow so you can access stored context from yesterday, last week, or even *last month*—whenever you need it.

Imagine what you could do if you could always recall past solutions, find specific links that were lost to your browser history, or remember what so-and-so said in that one Slack channel about that new staging release?

[The Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) ](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2)<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2">engine</a> ensures that *nothing* slips through the cracks.

The new, incredibly powerful [Workstream Activity](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/workstream-activity) feature provides a sleek UI for interacting with saved data from up to **9 months ago** in an easily digestible *LTM Roll-Up* format, allowing you to start conversations with that context or copy and download it.

<Callout type="tip">
  Read our [documentation on the new Long-Term Memory (LTM-2) Engine](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) for more information on what it is and how it works.
</Callout>

### MCP Support

The Pieces for Developers suite, powered by the LTM-2 Engine through PiecesOS, also provides support for [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/get-started) through Server-Sent Events (SSEs).

With the Pieces MCP, you can thread rich workflow context stored in the Pieces Drive through to [Cursor](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/cursor), [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/github-copilot), [Goose](https://docs.pieces.app/products/mcp/goose), and other IDEs and productivity tools, making Pieces a *platform* for using long-term context in other workflows outside of just the Pieces Desktop App.

<Callout type="tip">
  To integrate the Pieces MCP into one of the available integrations, copy the SSE endpoint URL and/or `.json` schema into your IDE of choice.

  You can find the MCP URL inside the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** tab within **Settings**.

### Pieces Copilot

Engage with generative AI using cloud-hosted or local-only LLMs to solve challenges, generate new code, debug tricky issues, or get a second pair of eyes on some complex logic—all with real-time, context-aware assistance.

The [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/copilot) offers optional integration with Long-Term Memory, so you can ask it about previous GitHub commits, request help refactoring your code based on a discussion with a coworker from the other day, and more.

### Pieces Drive

Transform the way you manage your code snippets, documentation, and creative ideas with [Pieces Drive.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop/drive)

Save and organize your materials in one place, then watch as AI-enriched metadata brings context to every snippet—whatever the objective, Pieces Drive makes it simple to find exactly what you need.
