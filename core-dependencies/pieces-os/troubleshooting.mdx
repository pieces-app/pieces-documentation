  <Tab title="macOS">
    **macOS | Checking OS Version**

    Pieces Suite applications require a minimum macOS version of **macOS Ventura.** If you’re experiencing installation issues, you should check your OS version to ensure it’s up-to-date.

    To determine your Apple device’s version of macOS:

    1. Click the **Apple** icon in the top-left corner of your screen
    2. Select `About This Mac`
    3. Under your device name (i.e., MacBook Air), look for the last line on the list, titled `macOS`

    The `macOS` line will report what version of macOS installed, e.g., `Sequoia 15.1.1`.

    Before installing PiecesOS, ensure your Windows system is fully updated:

    1. Click the **Start** button, then select `Settings`
    2. Click `Windows Update`
    3. Install any pending updates and restart your computer

    If the Pieces Installer is not working as intended, you could have an outdated version of Ubuntu.

    The minimum Ubuntu version that Pieces will run on is **Ubuntu 22.04 and above**.

    To check what version of Ubuntu you’re running:

    - Open **Settings** on Ubuntu
    - Locate the **System** section at the bottom of the left-hand side menu and click it
    - Open the **About** section and locate the **Operating System** label

    This section will will display your Ubuntu version information.

### Issues Launching PiecesOS (Windows)

Some users who have enabled Controlled Folder Access (CFA) as a security measure may receive a notification that Pieces is attempting to bypass this security wall.

To work around this issue, you must _add the executable path for PiecesOS_ to your allowlist.

<alert>
  PiecesOS fails to launch when CFA is enabled because the executable path for the application writes data to the Documents folder.

  CFA disables and blocks any request to modify files (in this case, writing & saving data), so PiecesOS cannot launch itself.
</alert>

Keep in mind that this path references the specific PiecesOS version and will change over time as you continue to update the software.

You can also disable CFA as a security measure if you do not require it as part of an enterprise scenario or for any other reason.

To decide which apps PiecesOS has access to, you can [easily enable and disable specific sources from the Long-Term Memory Access Control](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os/quick-menu#long-term-memory-access-control) panel.
