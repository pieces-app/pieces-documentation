## Materials in Pieces Drive

With Pieces Drive and PiecesOS for Obsidian plugin, you can save all kinds of code snippets and easily find, edit, and reuse them whenever, wherever, and however you need.

Here are some examples of developer materials you can reuse:

***

| `Logging Utilities`    | A helper function for detailed server-side logging with timestamps and error levels.                        | Speeds up debugging and monitoring by inserting reliable logging methods.   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Validation Functions` | A function to validate JSON payloads or form inputs before submission.                                      | Ensures data integrity with reusable, thoroughly tested validation logic.   |
| `API Integration Code` | Prewritten `Axios` code for making GET or POST requests, complete with error handling and response parsing. | Reduces repetitive work when integrating RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints. |
| `Component Templates`  | A React functional component template with basic hooks and styling setup.                                   | Provides a consistent starting point for building new components.           |
| `Database Queries`     | A MongoDB query to retrieve active user data filtered by last login.                                        | Streamlines database tasks by reusing optimized query patterns              |

## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management

The Pieces Drive connects you with your notes and project files, allowing you to focus on what matters—building great software—while empowering you with tools for efficient code reuse.

* **Improved Productivity**: By quickly accessing and reusing code snippets, you can focus on solving new problems rather than resolving old ones.

* **Contextual Awareness**: Snippets are enriched with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches, helping you remember each piece of code's origin, purpose, and ideal usage scenarios.

* **Code Standardization**: Sharing best practices and reusable components ensures that uniform coding practices and conventions are available across teams and projects.

By using the Pieces Drive, you can capture and manage your snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:

### Save & Organize

Easily [save a function, script, or piece of boilerplate](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets) directly from the tool menu.

These snippets are saved to your personal Pieces Drive and enriched with context, metadata, and tags, making them easy to retrieve whenever you need them.

To save a snippet in Obsidian, right-click on the selected code and choose `Save to Pieces`.

### Search & Reuse

You can directly [search through your collection of saved materials in Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/search-reuse) from within Obsidian, allowing you to find snippets quickly by keyword or context.

To search, access the **Search Pieces** action from the sidebar in the Pieces Drive tab.

Enter your query into the search bar and press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to see the search results.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/obsidian_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/search_process.gif" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

Any related snippets will appear in the results list. From there, you can press `return` (macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, rendered neatly inside the editor.

### Sharing

Share your snippets directly with team members in Obsidian, even if they don’t use Pieces.

<Callout type="tip">
  This can be done without the recipient needing a Pieces for Developers Account.
</Callout>

Sharing useful bits of code can help remove productivity blockers, especially if a co-developer is unfamiliar with the project or if they’re a junior developer.

For example, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without additional setup.

These shared links also retain their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), including tags, descriptions, and other information, making it easier for teammates to understand and utilize the code.

To share a snippet in Obsidian, highlight the text you’d like to share, right-click, and click `Share Via Pieces Link`.

This generates a link you can share with teammates, ensuring easy access to your reusable code.

## Use Cases

With the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin, [your snippets become a powerful library](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share them across your projects, all within the Pieces Drive.

Here are some examples of how you can use them:

### Reusable Code Snippets for Data Science

If you frequently work on complex data science projects, algorithm design, or data processing pipelines, you can save reusable code snippets in your Pieces Drive.

These snippets can be easily imported into Obsidian to document workflows, analyze results, and iterate on solutions in future projects.

```python

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  

data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  
 
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler  
scaler = MinMaxScaler()  
data[['feature1', 'feature2']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])  

print(data.describe())  
```

### Code Snippet Documentation

Suppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets) that does precisely that, allowing you to import it over to Obsidian for documenting it:

```go

func watchFileChanges(path string) {
	watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer watcher.Close()

	err = watcher.Add(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for {
		select {
		case event := <-watcher.Events:
			if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {
				fmt.Println("Modified file:", event.Name)
			}
		case err := <-watcher.Errors:
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		}
	}
}
```
