# Searching

## Finding Saved Materials

To locate your snippets, use the Pieces Sidebar menu or the search feature:

Type in your search query.

Scroll through the results or use the arrow keys to find your desired snippet.

Click on the snippet to open it and view its content, associated metadata, and quick actions.



To narrow down your search, you can use tags, descriptions, names, types, or even languages themselves.

## Adding Filters to Your Search

Saved snippets being viewed in the Pieces Drive Sidebar can be sorted and filtered to narrow down your search results.

Click on the search bar at the top of the Pieces Drive Sidebar.

Apply quick filters such as Titles, Annotations, or Content that appear below the search bar.

Enter specific tags or keywords in the search bar to refine the displayed snippets.



Click the icon at the top of the sidebar (e.g., clock icon for recent). The icon changes based on the selected sorting method.

Select your preferred sorting order, such as Recent, Suggested, Alphabetical, or Language.



## Viewing and Reusing Saved Snippets

Saved snippets can be viewed alongside their saved metadata by opening them directly from the Pieces Sidebar and clicking on them in the Pieces Drive once they’ve been found.

From this view, you can use Quick Actions, copy the snippet, or insert it at the cursor in your editor. Click Open Markdown Preview to see the snippet in markdown preview mode, or click on the snippet for a quick overview.



From this view, you can use the Pieces Actions button at the bottom of the snippet to copy it, edit it, update annotations, generate a shareable link, toggle the visibility of the Pieces Actions buttons, or highlight and right-click to copy, or use ⌘+c (macOS) or ctrl+c (Windows/Linux) to copy to your clipboard.

You can view snippets by opening the Pieces Drive Sidebar in Obsidian by clicking the Pieces icon on the left-hand side of your screen.

Once in the sidebar, you can insert a snippet into your note by clicking the Insert at Cursor button.



You can also right-click a snippet and select Copy to Clipboard, allowing you to paste it anywhere you need.



When using the Pieces Drive Sidebar in Obsidian, you can click on the three vertical dots on a saved code snippet to delete it, or select from 6 additional options:

## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product within the Pieces Suite utilizes PiecesOS to gather information regarding the context of your snippets.

When you modify a snippet in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App—like changing its name or description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates are automatically shown in your Pieces for Obsidian Plugin without the need for refreshing.

If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the troubleshooting guide for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
