## Having Trouble with Pieces for Obsidian?

If the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin isn’t working as expected, try the following troubleshooting steps.

<on-device-storage />

### Ensure You Have the Latest Versions

Confirm you’re using the latest version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=pieces-for-developers">Pieces for Obsidian Plugin</a> from the Obsidian community plugins marketplace. The minimum functioning version permitted is currently **1.7.7,** and the newest version of [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os), which has a minimum functioning version of **11.0.0**.

### Check PiecesOS Status

Ensure that PiecesOS is running. It must be active for the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin to function properly.

### Restart Obsidian After Updates

If you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin, restart Obsidian to apply the updates properly.

If the issue still persists, contact the <a target="_blank" href="https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-obsidian">Pieces support team</a>.

### Refreshing Copilot Chats

If you're using the Pieces Copilot chat and disconnect from WiFi or encounter issues with a cloud-based LLM, you may need to refresh the chat. This can resolve issues such as the LLM appearing to "hang" (e.g., generating a response that turns out to be an infinite loop).

Click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window and select **Refresh**.
