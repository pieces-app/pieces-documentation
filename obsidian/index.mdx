When you save snippets to your Pieces Drive with Pieces in Obsidian, they are enriched with AI-generated metadata, such as [tags, titles, authorship details, and descriptions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), keeping everything organized and easily accessible.

Here are some brief descriptions of the different material management options available within the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin:

- `Enriching`: Automatically add relevant metadata like [tags, titles, and descriptions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet) to improve the organization of your snippets.
- `Sharing`: [Share snippets with](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/sharing) your team, enabling collaboration and knowledge exchange.
- `Searching`: [Search your saved snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/search-reuse#via-search-feature) using keywords, tags, or other metadata to find the relevant code or text when needed.

 offers powerful search tools to find and access your snippets saved to Pieces Drive quickly. You can search using keywords, tags, or other metadata, making locating relevant snippets within your notes and projects easy.

In Obsidian, you can perform broad searches or refine results using specific terms like function names, keywords, or tags, making it easy to locate the exact snippet you need.

To search for snippets, open your **Obsidian Vault** and navigate to the **Pieces** plugin in the sidebar.

You can input your query from the search bar at the top of the Pieces panel. You can search by specific terms, tags, or even parts of snippets.

Once you find the snippet you're looking for, you can easily insert it directly into your note or project by selecting `Insert At Cursor`. Once found, snippets <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/drive/sharing">
