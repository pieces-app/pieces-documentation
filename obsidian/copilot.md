# Pieces Copilot

The Pieces Copilot in the Pieces for Obsidian Plugin boosts your workflow with AI features like integrated LLMs for generating code, commenting, saving and searching snippets, using AI Quick Actions, and much more.

## Generative AI Conversations

Facing an issue or not sure how to tackle a challenge? You can ask the Pieces Copilot specific questions directly in Obsidian using the Copilot Chat side window.

You can ask questions that don't need context, like “What is the basic format for a JSON object?” or more detailed questions where the Pieces Copilot requires context from your active note.



## Adding Conversation Context

Contextual awareness lets the Pieces Copilot help you solve problems faster by providing answers that are relevant to the issue you're facing and your notes.

To use this feature, include details like error messages or file context for more accurate responses from the LLM conversation.

You can also add multiple files and other items as context to your question, giving the Pieces Copilot comprehensive information to help you troubleshoot.



Start by right-clicking a selection and selecting the following option from the tool menu:



## Selecting Your Pieces Copilot Runtime

Choose between different LLMs directly within the Obsidian Editor by accessing the sidebar and selecting your preferred model by clicking the currently utilized LLM under Active Model (GPT-4o Mini).

Options range from lightweight models for simple queries to advanced models for in-depth analysis, as well as local and cloud-based LLMs.

This flexibility allows you to tailor Pieces Copilot to your specific development needs, whether speed or accuracy.
