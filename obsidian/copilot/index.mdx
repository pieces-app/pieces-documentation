## Generative AI Conversations

Facing an issue or not sure how to tackle a challenge? You can [ask the Pieces Copilot specific questions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/copilot/chat) directly in Obsidian using the Copilot Chat side window.

You can ask questions that don't need context, like *“What is the basic format for a JSON object?”* or more detailed questions where the Pieces Copilot requires context from your active note.

You can also add multiple files and other items as context to your question, giving the Pieces Copilot comprehensive information to help you troubleshoot.

Options range from lightweight models for simple queries to advanced models for in-depth analysis, as well as **local** and **cloud-based LLMs.**
