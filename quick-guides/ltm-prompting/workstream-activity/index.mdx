***

The [Pieces Workstream Activity view](https://docs.pieces.app/products/quick-guides/ltm-prompting/workstream-activity) provides summaries of all activities captured in 20 minute blocks, called *LTM Roll-Ups.*

You can use these to find memories that you can then query, or to even track new memories that you can share with colleagues to provide relevant context to them.

Workstream Activities can be filtered by keyword to help you find activities related to a project, concept, bug in your code, and more. Once filtered, you can use these results as context for your chats.

## In This Guide

Discover real-life use cases for the Workstream Activity view, and use it capture and filter entire project contexts, generate process documentation, and create detailed standup summaries using LTM roll-ups.

Practical examples demonstrate how to turn these activity ‘snapshots’ into shareable references, from markdown exports to live discussions in Pieces Copilot chats, or search through them with various filters.

  Workstream Activities can be exported as markdown or raw text, then sent to another Pieces user, who can then add these as context to their own Pieces Copilot chat.

## Share All Context for a Project

If your project has a unique name, or other identifier that is easy to query for, then you can filter all Workstream Activities for that keyword—this will then give a historical overview of your activities with that project.

Once you have this, you can either open it all in a Pieces Copilot chat and have the LLM create a detailed summary report to share with someone else, or you can export and share the activities directly, either as markdown files, or as raw text.

## Create a Summary To Document a Process

When some folks are documenting a process, they often create a video which is shared with colleagues.

The problem with this approach is that it misses important context, such as links or text from documentation, which must be shared separately and is difficult for the recipient to search.

By using Pieces, you can go through a process by checking documents, chats, emails, and code—then, you can create a new Workstream Activity for the time you spent.

This summary can be shared with your colleagues and will include text details like links to the documents you read, information about people involved in the conversations, links to code, and more.

## Turn Summaries into PRs and Reports

Pieces can help you create a summary of completed work based on details like tickets. For instance, if you're a developer and need to participate in an asynchronous daily standup, you can use Pieces to create a summary of tickets resolved—deep-links included.

You can do this by going through your ticket system and reviewing all the tickets you worked on the previous day.

Then, create a new Workstream Activity for the time you spent reviewing, which will include deep links to the tickets. You can use this raw content for your daily standup or ask the Pieces Copilot to summarize it in a more suitable format.
