## Why Use Quick Guides?

Pieces Quick Guides help you quickly understand and effectively utilize powerful features like the Long-Term (LTM-2) Memory Engine and Pieces Copilot.

Capture context from your browser, summarize meetings with coworkers, find closed GitHub Issues from last month that were just mentioned in that Slack channelâ€”_and thatâ€™s just the beginning._

You can get a lot done with Pieces, and we want to help you get started!
