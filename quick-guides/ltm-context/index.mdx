## In This Quick Guide

In this Quick Guide, youâ€™ll use [Pieces Long-Term Memory](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os#ltm-2) to save context from a website, then prompt the Pieces Copilot to tell you what it saw.

This demonstrates how Pieces can capture information from any application and make it available to you in the Pieces Copilot.

### Capture Context

With LTM enabled, Pieces captures workflow context from every actively used window, including the browser youâ€™re using to read this Quick Guide.
