## Generative AI Conversations

If you're facing an issue or stuck on a difficult debug, ask the Pieces Copilot specific questions directly in your terminal using `pieces ask`.

You can ask questions that don't need context, like _“What is the basic format for a JSON object?”_ or more detailed questions where the Pieces Copilot requires context from your saved materials.
