## Viewing and Reusing Saved Snippets

[Saved snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/drive/save-snippets) can be viewed with their metadata by opening them directly from the Pieces Web Extension. Just click on them in the Pieces Drive once you've found them.

From this view, you can use Quick Actions or copy the snippet in your browser. You can also click on the snippet for a quick overview.

From this view, use the `Pieces Actions` button at the bottom of the snippet to copy, edit, update annotations, generate a shareable link, toggle the visibility of the Pieces Actions buttons, or highlight and right-click to copy.

<tip>
  You can press `⌘+c` (macOS) or `ctrl+c` (Windows/Linux) to copy to your clipboard.
</tip>

### via Pieces Sidebar

You can view saved materials by opening Pieces Drive in your browser.

Click the Pieces icon in the extension list, click the dropdown menu at the top left of the extension, and select `Pieces Drive`.

Once in the snippet, you can copy a snippet from Pieces Drive and use that material anywhere you’d like.

## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product within the Pieces Suite utilizes [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to gather information regarding the context of your snippets.

When you modify a snippet in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop">
Pieces for Developers Desktop App</a>

—like changing its name or description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates are automatically shown in your [Pieces Web Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/get-started#supported-browsers) without the need for refreshing.

<tip>
  If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/web-extension/troubleshooting) for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
