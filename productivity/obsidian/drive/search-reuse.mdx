## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product within the Pieces Suite utilizes [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to gather information regarding the context of your snippets.

When you modify a snippet in the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop">
Pieces for Developers Desktop App</a>

—like changing its name or description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates are automatically shown in your <a target="_blank" href="https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=pieces-for-developers">
Pieces for Obsidian Plugin</a>

 without the need for refreshing.

<tip>
  If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/obsidian/troubleshooting) for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
