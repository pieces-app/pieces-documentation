## Saving Materials

Save code snippets to the Pieces Drive in two ways: use the right-click menu or save embedded buttons in code sections.

You can use this feature to save all kinds of proper markdown and code materials, such as:

- API endpoint definitions
- Utility functions or commonly used helper methods
- Predefined templates for organizing notes
- Task Lists
- Code Blocks
- Reusable patterns for internal or external links

### via Right-Click Menu

To capture useful code snippets via the right-click menu:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Highlight the Section">
    Select the section you want to save.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Right-click on the Highlighted Section">
    Open the context menu by right-clicking on the selected section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Save to Pieces">
    From the menu, select Save to Pieces.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### via Copilot Chat

You can take any code block existing in your Copilot Chat and click `Save to Pieces`—like code generated by Pieces Copilot, code blocks you added as context that weren’t saved as individual snippets, and any other kind of code.

To do so, click the `Save to Pieces` button on any code block within the Copilot Chat view.

## What’s Stored When You Save a Material

When you save a snippet to your Pieces Drive, it’s more than just the code that gets stored.

The Pieces Copilot captures:

- `Type`: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) with it’s code language.
- `Associated Tags`: Keywords associated with the snippet for easier searching.
- `Custom Description`**:** Specifies precisely which _lines_ (in numerical form) the snippet is from, as well as the file from which it originated—very useful for mind-mapping.
- `Smart Description`: AI-generated descriptions that summarize the snippet’s purpose and function.
- `Suggested Searches`: Related searches that help you discover similar snippets.
- `Related Links`: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.
- `Related People`: Associated collaborators or contributors.

Additionally, the Pieces Copilot **scans saved snippets for sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens, to ensure no confidential data is accidentally stored.

## Where Saved Materials Live

Saved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring accessibility even when offline. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension or plugin—or even the Pieces Desktop App—has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials.

There are two ways to find your saved snippets—via the `Pieces Explorer` menu, or with the `Pieces: Search Pieces` feature.
