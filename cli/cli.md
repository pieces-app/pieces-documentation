Through the Pieces CLI, developers can boost productivity by having AI-driven conversations that use relevant notes and folders as context, all within their terminal.



With Pieces Drive and PiecesOS in their terminal, developers can save, search, and share their code snippets. This enhances productivity by making reusable code accessible and organized within their notes and project files.



## Using Pieces Copilot

The Pieces CLI enhances your workflow by letting you save, manage, and share snippets in the terminal. It offers features like snippet enrichment, sharing via custom links, and seamless integration with your development environment.

To explore available options, run pieces help within your terminal.

From here, you’ll find several actions, including:

Edit: Change the name and classification of the material within Pieces Drive from directly within the terminal.

Create and Delete: Pieces CLI allows you to manage your snippets easily from within your terminal, allowing you to create and delete snippets.



## Managing Your Code Snippets

Saving and managing materials with the Pieces CLI is done with lightweight and familiar terminal-style commands.

To save a snippet, copy a section of text or code to your clipboard, head over to Pieces CLI, and type pieces create. If you’re in pieces run mode, you can just type create.

Common snippet types include utility functions, API requests, and reusable code blocks.

When you save snippets to your Pieces Drive with Pieces CLI, they get AI-generated metadata like tags, titles, authorship details, and descriptions. This keeps everything organized and easy to access and use at any point.



Pieces CLI provides you with powerful search tools to quickly find and access your snippets that you previously saved to Pieces Drive.

There are three different search methods: Fuzzy Search, Neural Code Search, and Full Text Search.

To search for snippets, while Pieces CLI is open, type search “query”.

You can also opt-in to using Neural Code Search with —mode ncs or Full Text Search with —mode fts.

Your query must be encapsulated in quotations for Pieces CLI to capture your full prompt

A new terminal window will open and you’ll be presented with a list of materials that closely match your query.

Scroll down or up with the arrow keys and select the material by pressing enter. The material will display with its attributes and the code that was stored in the material.
