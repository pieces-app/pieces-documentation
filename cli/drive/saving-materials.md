# Saving Materials

The Pieces CLI offers various methods to save code snippets, guaranteeing that your most valuable code is consistently accessible.

## Saving Code Snippets to Pieces Drive

Storing developer materials, such as snippets of boilerplate code, is an excellent way to build a helpful code collection in your Pieces Drive.

This helps you save time when writing generic code in various forms. The Pieces CLI offers a create feature designed to assist you with this.

You can use this feature to save all kinds of functional code materials, like:

API endpoint definitions

Utility functions or commonly used helper methods

Code templates for starting new modules

Reusable logic for error handling or authentication

## How to Save Materials

For Pieces CLI, you can save a snippet to your Pieces Drive with one command.

Opening a terminal on your device depends on your platform: Open your OS’ search bar and enter terminal(macOS/Linux) or CMD(Windows).

Select a section of code or text you want to save and copy it to your clipboard.

The pieces will use what you have copied to the clipboard as the snippet.

In your terminal, you can now enter pieces create, which will automatically save your clipboard as a new snippet.

If you’re within the Pieces CLI pieces run mode, you can enter create.



## What’s Stored When You Save a Snippet

When you save a snippet to your Pieces Drive, more than just the code is stored.

The Pieces Copilot captures several different kinds of metadata:

Type: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) and its programming language.

Associated Tags: Keywords linked to the snippet for easier searching.

Custom Description: Specifies exactly which lines (by number) the snippet is from and the file it came from—handy for mind-mapping.

Smart Description: AI-generated summaries that explain the snippet’s purpose and function.

Suggested Searches: Related searches that help you find similar snippets.

Related Links: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.

Related People: Associated collaborators or contributors.



Furthermore, the Pieces Copilot reviews stored snippets for sensitive data, including API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens, ensuring that no confidential information is unintentionally saved.

## Where Saved Snippets Live

Saved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring offline accessibility. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension, plugin, or even the Pieces Desktop App, has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials with Pieces Drive.

You can find your saved snippets via the pieces list command or the pieces search feature.
