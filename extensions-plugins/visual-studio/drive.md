# Pieces Drive

Materials are useful pieces of code you can save, share, reuse, modify, and integrate into future projects to increase productivity and save time.

## Materials in Pieces Drive

With the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, you can save all types of code snippets directly to your Pieces Drive and easily find, edit, share, and reuse them whenever you need.

Here are some examples of developer materials you can reuse:

Logging Utilities

A helper function for detailed server-side logging with timestamps and error levels.

Speeds up debugging and monitoring by inserting reliable logging methods.

Validation Functions

A function to validate JSON payloads or form inputs before submission.

Ensures data integrity with reusable, thoroughly tested validation logic.

API Integration Code

Prewritten Axios code for making GET or POST requests, complete with error handling and response parsing.

Reduces repetitive work when integrating RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints.

Component Templates

A React functional component template with basic hooks and styling setup.

Provides a consistent starting point for building new components.

Database Queries

A MongoDB query to retrieve active user data filtered by last login.

Streamlines database tasks by reusing optimized query patterns

## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management

The Pieces for Visual Studio extension connects you with your code and project files, letting you focus on building great software while offering tools for efficient code reuse and management.

Improved Productivity: Access and reuse saved code snippets quickly, so you can spend more time solving new problems than revisiting old ones.

Contextual Awareness: Snippets come with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches, helping you remember their origin, purpose, and best usage scenarios.

Code Standardization: Share best practices and reusable components to ensure consistent coding practices and conventions across teams and projects.

Use the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension to effectively capture, manage, and reuse snippets, streamlining your daily tasks and improving your workflow.

Easily save a function, script, or piece of boilerplate directly from the tool menu.

These snippets are saved to your personal repository and enriched with context, metadata, and tags, making them easy to retrieve whenever you need them.



To save a snippet in Visual Studio, right-click on the selected code and choose Save Current Selection to Pieces.



You can also save the entire file to your Pieces Drive by right-clicking anywhere in your code, hovering over Pieces in the tool menu, and clicking Save Active File to Pieces.



You can directly search through your collection of saved materials from within Visual Studio, allowing you to find snippets quickly by keyword or context.

To search, you can either right-click, hover over Pieces, and select Search Pieces Drive or click the search bar in your Pieces Drive view and type your query.

Then, enter your query into the search bar and press enter to view the search results.



Any related snippets will appear in the results list. From there, you can press enter to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, neatly rendered in Markdown as a separate tab.

Your snippets can change as your project grows, adapts to new requirements, or when you switch to new files. In the Pieces Drive view, search for a snippet and click the edit (pencil) icon to open it in a new tab in Visual Studio.

Edit your code and use ctrl+s to save, updating the snippet in your repository.



This keeps your library current and aligned with your project's progress, making your materials more efficient in the long run.

Sharing useful code snippets can help overcome productivity hurdles, especially if a co-developer is new to the project or less experienced.

For instance, a teammate handling server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without extra setup.

These shared links also come with their original enriched metadata, including tags, descriptions, and other details.

To share a snippet using the Pieces Extension for Visual Studio, right-click on selected code, hover over Pieces, and choose Share Current Selection. This will send your code to the cloud, generate a link, and copy it to your clipboard.



You can send anyone a shareable link containing your code snippet, even if they donâ€™t use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.

## Use Cases

With the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, your snippets transform into a robust library of reusable code. You can organize, search, edit, and share these snippets across various projects.

Here are some ways you might use them:

Suppose you often work on projects that require scheduling tasks at regular intervals.

Instead of writing the same code for each new project, you can write a reusable function, then save it to your Pieces Drive.

This enables you to apply a well-designed scheduling function across different applications, such as this:

Suppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive that does precisely that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:
