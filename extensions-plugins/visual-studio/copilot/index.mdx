## Generative AI Conversations

Facing an issue or not sure how to tackle a coding challenge? You can [ask the Pieces Copilot specific coding questions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/chat) directly in Visual Studio using Pieces Copilot in the `Solution Explorer`.

You can ask any question that doesn’t require context, such as _“What is the basic format for a JSON object?”,_ or more in-depth questions where the Pieces Copilot needs context from your active code.

## Adding Conversation Context

Contextual awareness enables the Pieces Copilot to help you solve problems more quickly by providing answers that are relevant to the issue you're dealing with and your code.

You can add context by selecting specific lines of code or entire files directly from your active file.

- `Ask Copilot About Selection`: Includes the active selected code in the conversation.
- `Ask Copilot About Active File`: Includes the entire active file with the conversation for a broader range of context.

To use this feature, include details like error messages or [file context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/chat#adding-context-to-copilot-chats) for more accurate responses from the LLM conversation.

You can also add multiple files and other items as context to your prompt, giving the Pieces Copilot comprehensive information to assist you in troubleshooting.
