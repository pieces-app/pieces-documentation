# Code Comments

With the Pieces Copilot in the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension, you can quickly generate comments that clearly capture your code's functionality and intent.

## Commenting Code Selections with Pieces Copilot

Pieces Copilot analyzes and comments on selected code, generating precise, line-by-line explanations. This enhances readability and makes your code easier to understand.

A quick way to add documentation to a function is by using the AI Quick Actions feature, visible above actionable tasks in your code. This feature allows you to generate comments to explain the logic and purpose of your functions directly within your editor.

To get started:

Look for the Pieces button above individual functions in your code.

Click the Pieces Quick Action button to open the available options.

Choose Comment from the menu to let the Copilot generate meaningful documentation for the function.

Review the generated comments and click Accept Changes to insert them into your code.



You can also right-click a selected portion of code, hover over Pieces, and choose Comment Selection with Copilot. Pieces Copilot will suggest changes that contain comments on new sections.



## Why Use Code Comments?

Code comments are essential for maintaining a clean and well-documented codebase. They provide context for reviewers, allowing them to focus on functionality and understand complex reasoning, making the code easier to follow and maintain.

Good documentation improves code readability and accelerates onboarding for people unfamiliar with the codebase. This dual benefit supports current and future development by creating a strong foundation for upgrades and iterations.

Comments also serve as a memory aid, helping you remember the purpose and function of the code when revisiting it after a long time away.

That’s what makes the Pieces Copilot’s commenting feature so powerful. Whether you’re documenting a single function or hundreds of lines of code, simply highlight the desired code, click the Pieces CodeLens button, select Comment, and let Copilot take care of the rest.
