# Refactoring Code

Refactoring improves your code's structure and maintainability without changing its behavior. The Pieces for Visual Studio Extension simplifies this with its Modify Selection with Copilot feature.

## Modifying your Code with Pieces Copilot

Modify your code to change error handling, rename functions, and add functionality in one way.

Right-click the highlighted code you want to modify, hover over Pieces, and click Modify Selection with Copilot.

Once you click Modify Selection with Copilot, Pieces Copilot opens the Chat window in the Visual Studio sidebar, showing the proposed changes.

Review the modifications and decide whether to Accept them or use the Insert at Cursor option to place the suggestion where your cursor is. The updates will automatically be added to your codebase at the selected point, right at your cursor.



This method provides a quick and efficient way to refactor and improve your code without disrupting your workflow.

You can use Modify Selection with Copilot to add detailed logging to essential functions for better debugging and to break down long methods into smaller, more modular functions.
