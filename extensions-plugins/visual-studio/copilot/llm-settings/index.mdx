From here, you can browse and select from various available models, such as the local and cloud-based models listed [in the table at the top of this page.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/configuration#supported-llms)

Once you’ve chosen a new model, the switch is instant, allowing you to continue your work seamlessly with the selected model's capabilities—*no need to restart or refresh anything.*
