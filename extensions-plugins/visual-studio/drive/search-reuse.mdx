    **via Keyboard Shortcut**

    1. You can quickly open the search bar menu by pressing `alt+m`, letting go, and then quickly pressing the `f` key.

    Once you’ve opened the search bar, you can enter your search query to search for a specific snippet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a Snippet">
    Click on the snippet to see its content, metadata, and quick actions.

## Viewing and Reusing Saved Snippets

[Saved snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/save-snippets) can be viewed with their metadata by opening them directly from the Pieces Sidebar. Just click on them once you find them.

From this view, use Quick Actions to copy the snippet or insert it at your cursor in the editor. Click `Open Markdown Preview` to **see the snippet in markdown preview mode,** or click on the snippet for a quick overview.

## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product in the Pieces Suite uses [PiecesOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os) to collect information about the context of your snippets.

When you change a snippet in the [Pieces for Developers Desktop App](https://docs.pieces.app/products/desktop)—such as its name, description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates automatically appear in your [Pieces for Visual Studio Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.PiecesVisualStudio) without needing to refresh.

<info>
  If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/troubleshooting) for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
