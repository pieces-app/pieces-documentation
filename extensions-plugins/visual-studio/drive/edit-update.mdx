## How to Edit Snippets

To modify code you’ve saved to your personal repository, you can use the Pieces Drive view in Visual Studio.

If you don’t have it open, use the command palette shortcut `ctrl+shift+p` and type Pieces Drive, then click it or press `enter` to open the view.

  <Step title="Locating a Snippet">
    Inside the Pieces Drive view, you can select the snippet you want to edit from the scrollable list of saved materials, or use the **Search Bar** to enter a query and locate your desired snippet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Snippet">
    To start editing the material saved from your repository, click the **Pencil Icon**. Hovering over this icon reveals an `Edit Selected Material` \+ `ctrl+e` tooltip.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Snippet">
    Once you click the **Pencil Icon,** your saved code will open in a new tab and automatically be redirected to that tab. Make your changes as needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Snippet">
    After making the desired changes to the code snippet, use `ctrl+s` to save the snippet, after which you will be returned to your active file.

    You’ll see a success message at the top of the active file indicating your changes have been made successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Material Management Actions

From within the Pieces Drive view, you can click the **three vertical dots** to review a `Quick Actions` tab that shows available metadata that you can view or directly adjust for that snippet.

## Additional Tools while Editing

When you edit a saved snippet, you are opening a new file in Visual Studio to make those edits, which means that other Pieces functionalities, like functionalities provided by Pieces Copilot and Pieces Drive, are entirely available to you.

For example, when editing a snippet, right-clicking selected code will present you with the same toolbar and Pieces-related options (like `Save Current Selection to Pieces` or `Share Current Selection`).

This makes it easy to modify your saved code with the power that the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension gives you.
