## Saving Materials

Save code to Pieces Drive with the Pieces for Visual Studio Extension by using the right-click menu or hotkeys.

Use this feature to save all kinds of useful code materials, such as:

* API endpoint definitions

* Utility functions or commonly used helper methods

* Code templates for starting new modules

* Reusable logic for error handling or authentication

Suppose the Pieces Copilot window isn't open. In that case, you can open it using the methods below, or by opening the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p`, searching for `Pieces Drive`, and selecting it, or pressing enter, or by using the keybind `alt+m,e`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### via Copilot Chat

You can save any code block from your Copilot Chat by clicking Pieces > `Save to Pieces`. This includes code generated by Pieces Copilot, code blocks you've added as context but haven't saved as individual snippets, and any other code.

Just click the `Save to Pieces` button on any code block in the Copilot Chat view.

## Saving Active Files to Pieces

If you want to save a *big snippet, save* your entire file directly to Pieces.

To save your active file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-Click">
    Right-click within your active file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate the Pieces Section">
    Hover over the `Pieces` item in the right-click options.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Active File to Pieces">
    Click `Save Active File to Pieces`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

There are plenty of scenarios in which saving an entire file to your Pieces Drive is ideal, such as to:

* **Preserve Complex Codebases**: Save large, complete files like utility libraries, configuration files, or classes to keep all related functionality together.

* **Reuse in Future Projects**: Use full files in new projects without rebuilding smaller parts.

* **Keep Independent Files Versioned**: Store standalone files, like scripts or tools, as separate backups or versions outside source control.

## What’s Stored When You Save a Snippet

When you save a snippet to your Pieces Drive, more than just the code is stored.

The Pieces Copilot captures:

* `Type`: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) with its code language.

* `Associated Tags`: Keywords related to the snippet for easier searching.

* `Custom Description`**:** Specifies precisely which *lines* (in numerical form) the snippet is from and the file from which it originated—very useful for mind-mapping.

* `Smart Description`: AI-generated descriptions that summarize the snippet’s purpose and function.

* `Suggested Searches`: Related searches that help you discover similar snippets.

* `Related Links`: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.

* `Related People`: Associated collaborators or contributors.

Additionally, the Pieces Copilot **checks saved snippets for sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens, to ensure no confidential data is stored by mistake.

## Where Saved Snippets Live

Saved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring offline accessibility. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension, plugin, or even the Pieces Desktop App, has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials.

You can find your saved snippets in the `Pieces Drive` menu.
