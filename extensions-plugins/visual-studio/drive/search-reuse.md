# Searching Pieces Drive

The Pieces for Visual Studio Extension lets you quickly find saved snippets, keeping you productive without interrupting your workflow.

## Finding Saved Snippets

In Visual Studio, you can locate your snippets in two main ways.

To locate your snippets, use the Pieces Sidebar menu or the search feature:

There are three main ways to search your Pieces Drive via the Pieces Sidebar

via Right-Click Menu

Right-click in your editor window, hover over Pieces, and select Search Pieces Drive.

via Keyboard Shortcut

Once you’ve opened the search bar, you can enter your search query to search for a specific snippet.

Click on the snippet to see its content, metadata, and quick actions.



If you know exactly what you’re looking for, you can search for specific snippets:

Open the search bar at the top of the Pieces Drive Sidebar.

Type your search query into the search box.

Scroll through the results or use the arrow keys to select your desired snippet.

Click on the snippet to open it and view its content, metadata, and quick actions.



Search using tags, descriptions, names, types, or languages to narrow your results.

## Adding Filters to Your Search

To refine your search results, you can sort and filter saved snippets in the Pieces Drive Sidebar.

Click the search bar at the top of the Pieces Drive Sidebar.

Apply quick filters like Titles, Annotations, or Content that show up below the search bar.

Enter specific tags or keywords in the search bar to narrow down the snippets shown.



Click the icon at the top of the Pieces Drive sidebar (like the clock icon for recent). The icon changes depending on the sorting method you choose.

Choose your sorting order: Recent, Suggested, Alphabetical, or Language.



## Viewing and Reusing Saved Snippets

Saved snippets can be viewed with their metadata by opening them directly from the Pieces Sidebar. Just click on them once you find them.

From this view, use Quick Actions to copy the snippet or insert it at your cursor in the editor. Click Open Markdown Preview to see the snippet in markdown preview mode, or click on the snippet for a quick overview.



From this view, you can highlight and right-click to copy, or use ctrl+c to copy to your clipboard.

In the Pieces Drive sidebar, you can insert a snippet into your note by clicking the Insert at Cursor button.



You can right-click a snippet and select Copy to Clipboard to paste it wherever you need.



When using the Pieces Drive sidebar in Visual Studio, click on the three vertical dots on a saved code snippet to delete it or choose from 6 other options:

## Real-Time Snippet Streaming

Every product in the Pieces Suite uses PiecesOS to collect information about the context of your snippets.

When you change a snippet in the Pieces for Developers Desktop App—such as its name, description, tags, or any other metadata—those updates automatically appear in your Pieces for Visual Studio Extension without needing to refresh.

If your snippets aren’t updating immediately, refer to the troubleshooting guide for instructions on refreshing your snippet list.
