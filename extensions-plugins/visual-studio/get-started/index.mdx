### Setting Up PiecesOS

PiecesOS is a background service that runs on your computer. It handles local data processing and manages custom machine learning (ML) models used in Pieces software.

To use the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">Pieces for Visual Studio Extension</a>, you must install <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os">PiecesOS</a> on your operating system.

Click below to download PiecesOS for Windows.

<Callout type="tip">
  For enhanced security and better system integration, we recommend installing the `.exe` version, as more security protocols recognize and accept `.exe` files more than `.appinstaller` packages.
</Callout>

## Updating

The Pieces for Visual Studio Extension will automatically update when a new version is available.

<Callout type="tip">
  The `Auto Update` setting is enabled by default.
</Callout>

## Pieces Cloud / Pieces Account

Connecting to the Pieces Cloud is optional. However, it **provides additional features** like **data backups,** [**shareable links**](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive/sharing)**, and more.** You can enjoy the main functionalities of Pieces without an account.

You can log into your account and connect to the Pieces Cloud from the **Pieces Account** view, a tab which can be found next to the `Solution Explorer` view in your IDE’s sidebar.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/visual_studio_extension_assets/get_started/pieces_account_view.png" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

From here, you can click `Sign In / Sign Out` under the **Account** section, or `Connect / Disconnect` under the **Cloud** section.

Connecting your Pieces account and personal cloud allows you to access features like data backups and shareable links, but it is not required.

## Onboarding

The Pieces for Visual Studio extension has an interactive walkthrough that shows all of the steps in one panel. This onboarding page guides you on saving, viewing, and using saved materials, as well as how to get the most out of the Pieces for Visual Studio extension.

### Save Your First Material

Click `Save your first material`, and Pieces will open the [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/drive) to save a sample snippet, showing you how it works.

You'll see the snippet immediately in the **Saved Materials** list. This demonstrates how Pieces captures items and keeps them organized for easy reuse.

Click `View Your Saved Materials`, and Pieces Drive will open to your **Saved Materials**, displaying any snippets you saved earlier along with the new snippet generated above.

### Check Out the Pieces Copilot

Click `Open Your Pieces Copilot` to open the Pieces Copilot side panel. In the Pieces Copilot, you'll find **suggested prompts**, options to set context from folders or files, and quick options to access your saved materials.

Once you open the Copilot, the onboarding process is complete. You're ready to [ask questions about your code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/chat), [document it](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/documenting-code), or [refactor a selected material](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio/copilot/refactoring)—all within the Visual Studio interface.

### Ask Copilot with Your New Material

Click `Ask Copilot about Your Material`, and Pieces will add the new snippet to the Copilot chat with the sample prompt “What does this code do?”. Press `Enter` to send your snippet to the Copilot, and you'll get an explanation or suggestions about the snippet.
