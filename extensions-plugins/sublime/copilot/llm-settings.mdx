## Switching LLMs

The <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">
Pieces for VS Code Extension</a>

 currently supports [a wide range of different LLMs](https://docs.pieces.app/products/large-language-models), including both cloud-hosted and local models.

## How To Configure Your LLM Runtime

Switching the LLM model in the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin is straightforward, allowing you to choose the model that best fits your needs.

To get started, use the hotkey `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows / Linux) and enter `Pieces: Change LLM`.

This will open the LLM selection menu, where you’ll see all of the available LLMs you can choose from.
