## Why Use Code Comments?

Code comments are essential for **keeping a clean and well-documented codebase.**

They **provide context**, allowing reviewers to focus on functionality while **making complex logic clear**, ensuring the code is easier to follow and maintain.

Good documentation improves code readability and speeds up onboarding for newcomers to the codebase. This dual benefit supports both **current and future development**, creating a strong **foundation for upgrades and changes.**

That's what makes this feature so valuable. Need a few hundred lines of code documented? No problem—just use `Add Code Comments`.
