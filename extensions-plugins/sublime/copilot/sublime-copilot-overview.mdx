## Generative AI Conversations

If you're unsure how to implement a specific feature or stuck on a bug, you can [ask the Pieces Copilot coding-related questions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/sublime/copilot/chat) directly in Sublime. It will provide context-aware responses to help you move forward.

The Pieces for Sublime Text plugin provides various conversation features, all fully integrated with Pieces. You can activate the **Long Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)** for detailed, seamless context across your entire workflow, or start a limited context conversation in the text editor's side view.
