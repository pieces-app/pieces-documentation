## What’s Stored When You Save a Snippet

When you save a snippet to your Pieces Cloud, it’s more than just the code that gets stored.

The Pieces Copilot captures:

* `Type`: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) with it’s code language.

* `Associated Tags`: Keywords associated with the snippet for easier searching.

* `Custom Description`: Specifies precisely which *lines* (in numerical form) the snippet is from, as well as the file from which it originated—very useful for mind-mapping.

* `Smart Description`: AI-generated descriptions that summarize the snippet’s purpose and function.

* `Suggested Searches`: Related searches that help you discover similar snippets.

* `Related Links`: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.

* `Related People`: Associated collaborators or contributors.

Additionally, the Pieces Copilot **scans saved snippets for sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens, to ensure no confidential data is accidentally stored.

## Where Saved Snippets Live

Saved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring accessibility even when offline. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension or plugin—or even the Pieces Desktop App—has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials.

You can search your saved snippets with the `Pieces: Search` feature.
