# Pieces Copilot

Designed to be more than a code assistant, Copilot boosts productivity by helping you debug, ask coding questions, generate code, and insert comments—all within Sublime.

## Generative AI Conversations

If you're unsure how to implement a specific feature or stuck on a bug, you can ask the Pieces Copilot coding-related questions directly in Sublime. It will provide context-aware responses to help you move forward.

The Pieces for Sublime Text plugin provides various conversation features, all fully integrated with Pieces. You can activate the Long Term Memory Engine (LTM-2) for detailed, seamless context across your entire workflow, or start a limited context conversation in the text editor's side view.

Start by right-clicking an active file in Sublime Text and click Pieces: Add to Copilot Context.

Within the Pieces Copilot active chat, you can also add multiple types of context by clicking the message icon. After doing so a new menu will pop up asking what you’d like to add as context.
