## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management

The Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin connects you with your development environment, so you can focus on what matters—building great software—while empowering you with tools for efficient code reuse.

Improved Productivity: Focus on solving new problems rather than resolving old ones.

Contextual Awareness: Snippets enriched with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches help you remember the origin, purpose, and ideal usage scenarios for each piece of code.

Code Standardization: Sharing best practices and reusable components helps developers ensure uniform coding practices and conventions are available across different teams and projects.

By using the Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin, you can capture and manage these snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:

Users can save snippets by highlighting the desired code, right-clicking, and selecting the Save to Pieces option.

This will open a new Sublime Text tab with your new snippet. Additionally, each snippet is enriched with context, allowing you to insert well-documented, relevant snippets where they fit best in your projects.



This ensures that important pieces of code, like code fragments, functions, configuration files, and command-line instructions, are always available when you need them.



You can directly search through your collection of saved materials from within Sublime Text, allowing you to quickly find snippets by keyword or context.

To search you can open the command palette with ⌘+shift+p (macOS) or ctrl+shift+p (Windows/Linux), enter Pieces: Search, and select the algorithm that suits your search case best.



These intelligent search options ensure that you can find the exact snippet you need, even if you don't remember the exact details. They also prevent you from wasting time rewriting or searching for the same solutions across projects.

With a few keystrokes, you can open saved snippets from your local repository and make edits to keep your code evergreen and improve your most important pieces of code.

You can open your saved materials by opening the command palette with ⌘+shift+p (macOS) or ctrl+shift+p (Windows/Linux), enter Pieces: Open Saved Material, and search or select for the snippet you’d like to edit.

After selecting, the snippet will open up in a new page, where you can select Edit and make your necessary edits to the snippet.



Regularly revisiting your snippets ensures that your code evolves with your projects, adapting to new requirements and improvements. 

Is your teammate struggling to find important boilerplate code? Are they contacting you on vacation, urgently needing the shell script that keeps server #1 running?

This is where sharing snippets comes into play—this feature lets you share your code with team members, even if they don’t use Pieces.

This can be done without the recipient needing a Pieces for Developers Account.

Sharing useful code snippets can remove productivity barriers, especially when a co-developer is new to the project or a junior team member.

For example, a teammate managing server monitoring could use your shared script to automate daily tasks easily, saving time and effort without needing extra setup.

These shared links also include their original enriched metadata, such as tags, descriptions, and other details.

To share a snippet in Sublime Text, highlight the code, right-click, hover over Pieces, click Generate Shareable Link, and then use the pop-up to copy or dismiss the link for easy sharing with teammates.



## Use Cases

With Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin, your snippets become a robust library of reusable code that you can organize, search, edit, and share across projects.

Here are some examples of how you can use them:

Imagine yourself regularly tackling projects that require scheduling tasks to run at specific intervals.

Instead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, you can save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces repository.

This allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications that’s useful in a variety of scenarios:

If you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes, you can save a helpful snippet to your Pieces repository that does exactly that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:
