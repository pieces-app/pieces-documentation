## Updating

The Pieces for Sublime Text Plugin will automatically update when a new version is available via Package Control.

When the plugin updates, you’ll see a small success message pop-up in the center of your Sublime Text Editor.

## Onboarding

The Pieces for Sublime Text plugin has an interactive walkthrough that shows all the steps in one panel. This onboarding page guides you on saving, viewing, and using saved materials, helping you get the most out of the Pieces for Sublime Text plugin.



If PiecesOS is not installed or running on your system, you can launch it here. This section allows you to install or open PiecesOS directly from within Sublime.

When you click creation, Pieces will automatically generate you a sample snippet in a new tab and give you a few steps that will walk you through saving a snippet—right click on the snippet, hover over Pieces, and select Save to Pieces.



Click View Your Saved Materials—Pieces Drive will open to your Saved Materials, displaying any snippets you saved before and the newly generated snippet.

After clicking searching, a prompt window opens up where you can search for your snippet with three optional ways to search.



After clicking the prompt, Ask for help and get those bugs fixed, PiecesOS will open a new snippet with a hidden bug in a new window and guide you through the process of fixing it. You can right-click the snippet, hover over Pieces, go to Quick Actions, and select Fix a bug.



This is when you're introduced to opening Pieces Copilot. When you select Copilot, Pieces will open a new tab with Pieces Copilot ready for a prompt!

Once you open the Copilot, the onboarding step is done. You can now ask questions about your code, document it, debug errors, or refactor selected material—all within the Sublime Text interface.

You might encounter some sections of code, whether from GitHub or something you haven't looked at in a while. Pieces provides an explanation feature to help you understand what's going on in the code—this section shows you how to use it.

When you click explanation, a new tab will open. Right-click, hover over Pieces, go to Ask Copilot, and select Explain.

The final three steps provide useful information to help you use PiecesOS without any problems. Select documentation to access this guide and learn more about Pieces for Sublime Text.
