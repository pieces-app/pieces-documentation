## Features

Read some of the latest features you can find with in the Pieces for JupyterLab Extension below.

## Pieces Copilot

**Pieces Copilot** inside JupyterLab is your context-aware AI assistant, designed to help you work smarter with your notebooks.

Powered by qGPT and deeply integrated into the Pieces ecosystem, Copilot can answer questions specific to your code, suggest improvements, and provide real-time assistance—all based on the content of your notebook.

Whether you’re debugging, exploring new concepts, or documenting your workflow, Copilot helps you stay focused by delivering relevant insights without leaving your development environment.

Here’s how to use it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open PiecesOS">
    Ensure PiecesOS is open and up to date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the View">
    Click the bot icon in the top slider of the JupyterLab Extension to open Pieces Copilot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Prompting">
    Interact with the Pieces Copilot to get answers related to your notebook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="“Ask Copilot”">
    Highlight code, right-click, and select `Ask Copilot` for context-aware help based on your selected code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Enrich Selected Code

`Enrich Selected Code` allows you to instantly add helpful context to any piece of code within your Jupyter notebook.

Simply highlight a section of code, right-click, and choose the "Enrich with Description" option.

Pieces will generate a clear, concise explanation of what the code does—perfect for improving readability, onboarding collaborators, or creating better documentation. It's a fast, easy way to make your notebooks more understandable and maintainable.

### Realtime Streaming

Changes in other Pieces tools (Desktop App, VS Code, etc.) reflect in JupyterLab _automatically_.

Any snippet you save, edit, or enrich in JupyterLab is instantly reflected in other Pieces integrations—like the Desktop App, VS Code, or JetBrains plugins—without any extra steps.

## **Data Privacy, Security, and Offline-First Approach**

We prioritize your privacy and offline usability in the same spirit as JupyterLab.

- **Privacy and Security**—All data is stored locally, on your device.
- **On-Device ML**—80%\+ of ML runs locally, reducing server exposure.
- **Offline-First**—Works fully offline, with strong functionality.
- **Opt-In Cloud**: Optional cloud features—your data, your control.

## Configuration

You can personalize your experience with the Pieces for Developers JupyterLab Extension through the **Pieces Settings** menu.

This allows you to tailor how Pieces behaves to best fit your workflow:

- **Auto-open Snippet List View**: Choose whether the Pieces View should automatically open when you save a new snippet—perfect for keeping your saved work front and center.
- **Cloud Capabilities**: Toggle opt-in cloud features on or off. By default, Pieces is local-only, but you can enable cloud sync or sharing on a per-resource basis when needed.
- **Pieces Server Port**: Manually configure the server port used by Pieces if you're running a custom setup or need to resolve port conflicts.
- **Login/Logout of Pieces Cloud**: Seamlessly sign in or out of your Pieces Cloud account to access synced snippets across devices or keep everything stored locally, depending on your preference.

## Troubleshooting

If the Pieces for Developers JupyterLab Extension isn't working as expected, first check that **Pieces OS** is running—you should see the Pieces logo in your toolbar (macOS) or taskbar (Windows).

Make sure you have the latest versions of both the **Pieces JupyterLab Extension** and **Pieces OS (v8.0.0 or higher)**, and that your **JupyterLab version is 4.0.0 or above**.

After updating, always restart JupyterLab to apply changes.
