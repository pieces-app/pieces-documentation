## Onboarding

The Pieces for VS Code extension includes an interactive walkthrough that shows the different steps in one panel. This onboarding page will teach you how to save, view, and use saved materials and fully utilize Pieces for Visual Studio Code.

### Save Your First Material

When you click `Save Your First Material`, Pieces automatically opens the [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive) and stores a sample snippet to show you how everything works.

You’ll see that snippet immediately in the Saved Materials list, giving you a quick demonstration of how Pieces captures items and organizes themes.

### View Your Saved Materials

By clicking `View Your Saved Materials`, Pieces Drive will open up to your **Saved Materials**—showing you any saved snippets you had before and the newly generated saved snippet.

### Check Out the Pieces Copilot

Clicking `Open Your Copilot` triggers the Pieces Copilot side panel, as shown in the screenshots. In the Pieces Copilot, you’ll find **suggested prompts**, options to set context from folders or files, and quick links to your saved materials.

Once you open the Copilot, the onboarding step is marked as complete. You're ready to ask [questions about your code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/chat), [document it](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/documenting-code), or [refactor a selected material](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/refactoring)—all within the VS Code interface.

### Ask Copilot with Your Material

When you click `Ask Copilot about Your Material`, Pieces automatically adds the newly saved snippet to the Copilot chat with a sample prompt (like “What does this code do?”). Press `Enter` to send your snippet to the Copilot, and you’ll immediately receive an explanation or suggested improvements.
