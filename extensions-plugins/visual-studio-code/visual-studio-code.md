This extension is designed to offer two main pillars of functionality for developers working in the Visual Studio Code environment—Pieces Copilot and Pieces Drive.

## Enhanced AI Assistance

Through Pieces Copilot, developers can generate code solutions with context-based AI conversations, add code comments, troubleshoot, and fix bugs inside VS Code.



With Pieces Drive embedded in VS Code, developers can also save, edit, search, and share their code snippets, boosting productivity by keeping reusable code accessible.



## Using Pieces Copilot

Inside VS Code, the Pieces Copilot offers several powerful actions to enhance your coding workflow using generative AI.

To start, you can initiate a conversation with the LLM of your choice, providing as much context as needed by adding files, folders, or even entire repositories to the chat.

To explore options, select a portion of code, right-click, and hover over the Pieces item in the context menu.

From here, you’ll find several quick actions, including:

Modify Selection with Copilot: Edit or transform the selected code to improve readability, optimize performance, or adapt it for other needs.

Explain Selection with Copilot: Get detailed explanations of the code’s functionality.

Comment Selection with Copilot: Generate inline comments to improve code clarity.

You can also use the Ask Copilot About Active File action to provide more context about your project. This helps Pieces Copilot better understand your entire file and deliver more relevant suggestions.



The Pieces Copilot now comes packaged with AI Quick Actions, which are similar to CodeLens actions that sit above functions nearest your cursor.

With the new Pieces: Comment tool, the Pieces Copilot can generate meaningful, insertable documentation explaining your code’s purpose and function, and Pieces: Explain can quickly generate a breakdown of some code logic while simultaneously initiating a Copilot chat in the side window.

Pieces: Comment

Pieces: Explain

To get started, look for the AI Quick Actions buttons in your code. These buttons relocate depending on the location of the nearest visible functions. Then, click the documentation or explanation tool, depending on your use case.



## Using Pieces Drive

Saving and managing code snippets within Pieces Drive in the VS Code extension is simple and efficient.

To save a snippet, right-click the selected code, hover over Pieces, and choose Save Current Selection to Pieces. You can also use the Share option to share snippets with others.

Common snippet types include utility functions, API requests, and reusable code blocks.

When you save snippets to your Drive, Pieces enriches them with AI-generated metadata, such as tags, titles, authorship details, and descriptions, keeping everything organized and accessible.

You can find brief descriptions below of the different material management options available within the Pieces for VS Code Extension:

Save Current Selection to Pieces: Right-click a code block and save it to Pieces Drive with AI-enriched metadata, ensuring easy access to frequently used snippets.

Save Active File to Pieces: Save the entire active file to your repository in one action—ideal for preserving larger scripts or complete files.

Ask Copilot About Selection: Start a conversation with Pieces Copilot to gain insights, explanations, or suggestions for improvement for the selected code.

Ask Copilot About Active File: Analyze the active file with Pieces Copilot to get insights and recommendations for your codebase.

Share: Share snippets with your team by creating distributable copies of reusable code.

Search Pieces: Quickly find specific snippets in your repository using keywords, tags, or titles.



The Pieces for VS Code Extension offers powerful search tools to quickly find and access your saved snippets.

You can perform broad searches or refine results using specific terms like function names, keywords, or tags, making it easy to locate the exact code you need.

To search, right-click, hover over Pieces, and select Search Pieces.

This opens a search bar where you can input queries to find your snippets. Once found, snippets can be shared or copied directly into your project.
