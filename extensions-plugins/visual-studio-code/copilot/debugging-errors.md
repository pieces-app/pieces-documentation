## Fixing Bugs with Pieces Copilot

The Pieces Copilot in the Pieces for VS Code Extension offers AI-driven debugging that simplifies finding and fixing code issues in VS Code. This feature not only speeds up troubleshooting but also provides an opportunity to learn from the fixes suggested by the AI.

## Using the Debugging Tool

To start debugging, locate your project's error or problematic code segment.

Errors are usually indicated by red underscoring surrounding the error or problematic lines of code.

Then, right-click on the error, open the quick fix menu, and select Pieces: Fix. You will also see a Yellow Lightbulb. Clicking the Yellow Lightbulb will show Pieces: Fix, allowing you to debug the error on that line quickly.



Pieces Copilot will utilize whichever LLM you have currently active and analyze the issue. Then, it will open a Copilot chat with suggestions, regenerate the code, and provide the option Insert at Cursor with fresh code comments.

You can then choose to Accept or Insert at Cursor. Insert at Cursor will place the fixed code at the pointer’s position. Accept will replace the broken code with the fixed version.

## Why Debug with Pieces Copilot?

Debugging with Pieces Copilot smoothens error resolution and provides AI-driven insights in an experience that doesn’t detract from your workflow in VS Code.

This saves time by reducing the need to search for solutions online or navigate extensive documentation, keeping your workflow efficient and reducing distractions.

Additionally, each suggested fix includes an explanation, helping you understand and improve your coding practices as you debug.

The Pieces Copilot proactively identifies code issues—highlight your code, click the Yellow Lightbulb, and let it analyze the problem(s).
