## Overview

Pieces Copilot within the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">Pieces for VS Code Extension</a> integrates advanced AI capabilities into your coding workflow, like swappable LLMs for adding code comments, generating additional code, debugging, and more.

The Pieces Copilot allows you to generate intelligent code comments, access AI Quick Actions, and ask variable-context coding questions without leaving Visual Studio Code.

## Generative AI Conversations

Facing an issue or not sure how to tackle a coding challenge? You can [ask the Pieces Copilot specific coding questions](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/chat) directly in VS Code using the Copilot Chat side window.

You can ask any question that doesn’t require context, such as *“What is the basic format for a JSON object?”,* or more in-depth questions where the Pieces Copilot needs context from your active code.

## Adding Conversation Context

Contextual awareness allows the Pieces Copilot to help you overcome obstacles faster by providing answers that are *actually* relevant to the current issue you’re facing and to your code.

To use this feature, include details like error messages or [file context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/chat#adjusting-conversation-context) for more accurate responses from the LLM conversation.

You can also [add multiple files and other items as context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot/chat#adding-items-to-copilot-chats) to your question, giving the Pieces Copilot comprehensive information to help you troubleshoot.

Start by right-clicking some code and selecting one of the following options from the tool menu:

* `Ask Copilot About Selection`: Includes the active selected code in the chat.

* `Ask Copilot About Active File`: Includes the entire active file with the Copilot chat for a broader range of context.
