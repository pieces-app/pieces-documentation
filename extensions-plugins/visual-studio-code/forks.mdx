## Pieces for Cursor, Windsurf & Trae

Developers love Visual Studio Code because it’s open-source and flexible.

Since this IDE is open-source, the extensions available for the base code editor (VS Code) can also be found in the extension marketplace pages for these VS Code forked IDEs.

### What Is A VS Code Fork?

A **VS Code fork** is an independent IDE that starts with Microsoft’s MIT-licensed VS Code code-base, then layers on its own features (often AI tooling or workflow tweaks).

Because the underlying extension API is the same, the [Pieces for VS Code Extension](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code) installs and runs in these forks exactly as it does in stock VS Code.

## Installation for Supported Forks

Follow the steps below to get started with the Pieces for VS Code Extension in Cursor, Windsurf, or Trae.

## Updating

Auto-update is enabled by default—so when there’s an update available for download, or an update has finished downloading, you’ll see a pop-up modal in the bottom-right corner of your IDE.

<Tip>
