## Saving Code Snippets to Pieces Drive

Saving developer materials, like snippets of boilerplate code, is a great way to create a collection of useful code in your Pieces Drive.

This helps you save time when writing generic code that you've written in different forms before. The Pieces for VS Code Extension has a *Save Materials* feature to help you do exactly that.

You can use this feature to save all kinds of useful code materials, like:

* API endpoint definitions

* Utility functions or commonly used helper methods

* Code templates for starting new modules

* Reusable logic for error handling or authentication

## How to Save Materials

There are three ways to save code with the Pieces for VS Code Extension—through the right-click menu, by saving with hotkeys, or through the Pieces Copilot Chat view.

### via Right-Click Menu

To capture useful code snippets and save them to your Pieces Drive via the right-click menu:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your Snippet">
    Highlight the code you want to save
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Pieces Menu">
    Right-click on the highlighted code and hover on the `Pieces` option
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save your Snippet">
    Select either `Save Current Selection to Pieces` or `Save Active File to Pieces`

  </Step>
</Steps>

This will trigger a success message in the bottom-right corner of your screen to let you know that the save was successful.

### via Keyboard Shortcuts

If you’re a developer who avoids using their cursor as much as possible, you can instantly save your selected code using keyboard shortcuts.

To do this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your Snippet">
    Highlight the code you want to save
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save your Snippet">
    Use the `⌘+shift+v` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows/Linux) shortcut

  </Step>
</Steps>

### via Copilot Chat

You can take any code block existing in your Copilot Chat and click `Save to Pieces`—like code generated by Pieces Copilot, code blocks you added as context that weren’t saved as individual snippets, and any other kind of code.

To do so, click the `Save to Pieces` button on any code block within the Copilot Chat view.

## Saving Active Files to Pieces

If you want to save a *really* big snippet, try saving your entire file directly to Pieces Drive.

To save your active file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-Click the File">
    Right-click within your active file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate Pieces Options">
    Hover over the `Pieces` item
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the File">
    Click `Save Active File to Pieces`

    <Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/vs_code_extension_assets/using_snippets/saving_snippets/save_active_file_to_pieces.png" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

There are plenty of scenarios in which saving an entire file to your Pieces Drive is ideal, such as to:

* **Preserve Complex Codebases**: Save larger, cohesive files like utility libraries, configuration files, or classes to ensure you capture all interconnected functionality in one place.

* **Reuse in Future Projects**: Easily repurpose full files in new projects without reconstructing smaller snippets.

* **Keep Independent Files Versioned**: Maintain standalone files, such as scripts or tools, as independent backups or versions outside of source control.

## What’s Stored When You Save a Snippet

When you save a snippet to your Pieces Drive, it’s more than just the code that gets stored.

The Pieces Copilot captures:

* `Type`: Categorizes the snippet (e.g., API call, function, class) with it’s code language.

* `Associated Tags`: Keywords associated with the snippet for easier searching.

* `Custom Description`**:** Specifies precisely which *lines* (in numerical form) the snippet is from, as well as the file from which it originated—very useful for mind-mapping.

* `Smart Description`: AI-generated descriptions that summarize the snippet’s purpose and function.

* `Suggested Searches`: Related searches that help you discover similar snippets.

* `Related Links`: References to documentation, code repositories, or other relevant resources.

* `Related People`: Associated collaborators or contributors.

Additionally, the Pieces Copilot **scans saved snippets for sensitive information**, such as API keys, passwords, or authentication tokens, to ensure no confidential data is accidentally stored.

## Where Saved Snippets Live

Saved snippets are stored locally on your device, ensuring accessibility even when offline. This also means that any Pieces for Developers extension or plugin—or even the Pieces Desktop App—has constant, up-to-date access to your saved materials with Pieces Drive.

There are two ways to find your saved snippets—via the `Pieces Drive` menu, or with the `Pieces: Search Pieces` feature.
