## Actions from the Pieces Drive View

When you left-click on a saved snippet in the Pieces Drive, you are presented with a tool menu filled with Pieces functionalities—some of which are related to the [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot), and others which are designated [material management](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive) actions.

### Pieces Copilot Actions

To access the material management view, select one of the snippets from Pieces Drive. From this view, you can select a number of Copilot-centric actions—view them in the table below.

***

| `Add to Copilot Context` | Adds the snippet to the context of your existing Copilot Chat conversation.                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ask Copilot`            | Triggers the input modal and lets you type a prompt directly into the field without changing your active file view. |
| `Insert at Cursor`       | Inserts the code snippet at the point of your cursor inside your active file.                                       |
| `Shareable Links`        | Shows shareable links that have been generated for that snippet, if applicable.                                     |

## Additional Tools while Editing

*Layers upon layers of functionality*—that’s the goal of all Pieces for Developers plugins and extensions.

When you edit a snippet (by locating it in the Pieces Drive menu and clicking `Edit`), every single bit of Pieces functionality is available to you, even though you are in a view that’s removed from your main file.

Instead, the `Edit` view *becomes* your main file, so you can [generate code comments, debug, add it to context, and more.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/copilot)
