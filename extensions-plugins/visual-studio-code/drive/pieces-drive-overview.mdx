## Using Pieces Drive in VS Code

The **Pieces for VS Code Extension** improves development productivity and time management by providing powerful features like [saving](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets) and [reusing](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/search-reuse) saved materials, so your most important code is always available.

## Use Cases & Examples

Let's take a look at some examples:

| `Logging Utilities`    | A helper function for detailed server-side logging with timestamps and error levels.                        | Speeds up debugging and monitoring by inserting reliable logging methods.   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Validation Functions` | A function to validate JSON payloads or form inputs before submission.                                      | Ensures data integrity with reusable, thoroughly tested validation logic.   |
| `API Integration Code` | Prewritten `axios` code for making GET or POST requests, complete with error handling and response parsing. | Reduces repetitive work when integrating RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints. |
| `Component Templates`  | A React functional component template with basic hooks and styling setup.                                   | Provides a consistent starting point for building new components.           |
| `Database Queries`     | A MongoDB query to retrieve active user data filtered by last login.                                        | Streamlines database tasks by reusing optimized query patterns.             |

## Boosting Productivity with Snippet Management

With the Pieces for VS Code Extension, you can improve your productivity, standardize code, and maintain clarity across teams and projects by leveraging prewritten code.

The Pieces for VS Code Extension connects you with your development environment, so you can focus on what matters—building great software—while empowering you with tools for efficient code reuse.

- **Improved Productivity:** Focus on solving new problems rather than resolving old ones.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Snippets enriched with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches help you remember the origin, purpose, and ideal usage scenarios for each piece of code.
- **Code Standardization:** Sharing best practices and reusable components helps developers ensure uniform coding practices and conventions are available across different teams and projects.

By using the Pieces for VS Code Extension you can capture and manage these snippets in Pieces Drive to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:

### Save & Organize

Easily [save a function, script, or piece of boilerplate](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets) right from the tool menu or with a keyboard shortcut.

Not only are these snippets saved to your personal Pieces Drive, but they're enriched with context, metadata, and tags for easy retrieval.

To do this save a code snippet, right-click, and then hover on `Pieces` and choose `Save Current Selection to Pieces`—or you can use the keyboard shortcut by using `⌘+shift+'` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows/Linux).

### Search & Reuse

You can directly [search through your collection of saved materials](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/search-reuse) from within VS Code, allowing you to quickly find snippets by keyword or context.

To search, you can access the `Search Pieces` action in to ways—either from the command palette or with the right-click menu.

In both scenarios, you then enter your query into the dropdown menu, and press `return`(macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux).

Any related snippets will appear in the results list. From there, you can press `return`(macOS) or `enter` (Windows/Linux) to view your snippet, complete with all its saved context, rendered neatly inside the editor.

### Edit & Update

Your snippets can evolve as your project grows as you adapt to changing project requirements, or when you move onto new files within your codebase.

In the `Saved Materials` section of the **Pieces Drive**, you can [open your saved snippets or update the code](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) to meet current needs, and save the updated version back to Pieces.

This ensures that your library stays current, relevant, and aligned with your project's progress—plus, making your materials more efficient only helps you in the long run.

### Sharing

[Share your snippets directly with team members](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/sharing#how-to-share-a-saved-snippet), even if they don't use Pieces.

<tip>
  You can send a shareable link containing your code snippet to anyone, even if they don't use Pieces or have a Pieces for Developers account.
</tip>

Sharing bits of code you find useful can remove productivity blockers if co-developer is unfamiliar with the project, or if they're a junior.

For example, a teammate working on server monitoring can use your shared script to automate daily tasks without additional setup.

These shared links also include their [original enriched metadata](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#whats-stored-when-you-save-a-snippet), like tags, descriptions, and other information.

To share a snippet in VS Code, you can either highlight some lines of code, right-click, hover over `Pieces` and click `Share` or use keyboard shortcuts—`⌘+shift+i` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+i` (Windows/Linux).

This creates a link you can share with teammates, ensuring easy access to your reusable code.

## Use Cases

With Pieces for VS Code Extension, your snippets become a robust library of reusable code that you can organize, search, edit, and share across projects.

Here are some examples of how you can use them:

### Reusable Scheduling Functions

Imagine you're frequently working on projects that involve scheduling tasks at regular intervals.

Instead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, you can [save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces Drive.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets)

This allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications that's useful in a variety of scenarios:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval
func scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {
	ticker := time.NewTicker(interval)
	defer ticker.Stop()

	for {
		select {
		case <-ticker.C:
			task()
		}
	}
}
```

### File System Monitoring

If you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/visual-studio-code/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does exactly that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify"
)

// A reusable function to monitor file system changes
func watchFileChanges(path string) {
	watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer watcher.Close()

	err = watcher.Add(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for {
		select {
		case event := <-watcher.Events:
			if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {
				fmt.Println("Modified file:", event.Name)
			}
		case err := <-watcher.Errors:
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		}
	}
}
```
