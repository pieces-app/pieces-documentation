## Having Trouble with Pieces for VS Code?

If the Pieces for VS Code Extension isn’t working as expected, try the following troubleshooting steps.

<on-device-storage />

### Download the Latest Version(s)

First, confirm you’re using the latest version of the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode">
Pieces for VS Code Extension</a>

 from the Visual Studio Marketplace and the latest version of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os">
PiecesOS</a>

.

The minimum functioning version permitted is currently **10.1.12.**

### Restart VS Code After Updates

If you’ve recently installed or updated PiecesOS or the Pieces for VS Code Extension, restart the IDE.

Contact the [Pieces support team](https://getpieces.typeform.com/to/mCjBSIjF#docs-vscode) if the issue still persists.

### Pieces-Specific Fixes

Verify the health and status of PiecesOS and check off the boxes below if you are experiencing issues with Pieces Drive or Pieces Copilot within the Pieces for VS Code Extension.

### Check PiecesOS Status

Check to make sure PiecesOS is running. PiecesOS must be running for the Pieces for VS Code Extension to work.

### Refreshing Copilot Chats

You may need to restart or refresh the Pieces Copilot chat, especially if you’re using a cloud LLM and disconnect from WiFi.

These scenarios can occasionally cause the LLM to ‘hang’—to appear as if generating a response but eventually timing out, entering an infinite response loop, or experiencing other issues.

To do this, click the **three vertical dots** in the top-right corner of your Copilot Chat window, and click `Refresh`.
