## Pieces for JetBrains Plugin

The Pieces for JetBrains Plugin enhances your development experience by seamlessly integrating the best features from the Pieces suite directly into JetBrains IDEs, making your favorite tools readily accessible within your workspace.

It provides developers with powerful tools for **managing code snippets, debugging, and refactoring** within their familiar development environment.

- [Pieces Copilot:](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot) Users can start generative AI conversations and add files and folders as context to get the solutions they need, including out-of-IDE context with the optional Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2).
- [Pieces Drive:](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive) Effortlessly save, locate, and share frequently used code snippets, making it easier to organize your work, quickly access essential pieces of code, and collaborate effectively with others.
- [AI Quick Actions:](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/chat#ai-quick-actions) Fully integrated and Pieces-powered AI Quick Actions tools are built right into your code, making it even easier to access Pieces Copilot explanation and documentation features.

The Pieces for JetBrains Plugin verifies against the JetBrains IntelliJ Ultimate IDE, but works across the entire JetBrains suite of IDEs.

The minimum version required for the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin to work in your JetBrains IDE is **2023.1.**

If you're not quite sure what version your JetBrains IDE is, [you can click here to find out how to check it.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/configuration#checking-your-jetbrains-ide-version)

This plugin is currently available for use in any JetBrains IDE, such as:

The Pieces for JetBrains plugin provides developers with **two pillars of functionality**:

### AI Assistance with Pieces Copilot

Pieces Copilot offers [AI-assisted features](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot) like starting contextualized [generative AI conversations](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/chat), <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/copilot/documenting-code">
documenting code</a>

, and more.

### Material Management with Pieces Drive

Pieces Drive enables you to [save, edit, search, and share useful code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive) to boost your workflow productivity and streamline collaboration with others.

These features let developers store their favorite code in a personal, easy-to-access library. They can quickly review past work, find related authors and links with the extra details saved with each piece, and more.

## Using Pieces Copilot

You can perform **several decisive** **actions** with the Pieces Copilot inside of your JetBrains IDE, like starting a conversation directly inside the editor with your LLM of choice about a specific code snippet, fragment, folder, or terminal output.

The **Ask Copilot** feature is the backbone of the Pieces Copilot experience.

Pieces for Developers recently rolled out its new **AI Quick Actions** feature—similar to VS Code's Codelens—which allows for select quick actions powered by Pieces Copilot, namely `Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`.

<Tip>
  The Quick Action tools—`Pieces: Explain` and `Pieces: Comment`—are above the function nearest to your cursor.
</Tip>

Using either AI Quick Actions triggers the Pieces Copilot conversation window, where you can find the output from the LLM of your choice.

These AI Quick Action tools live above certain pieces of code, like functions, so you always have easy access to them.

## Managing Code Snippets

When you save code to your personal repository, Pieces **automatically enriches the snippet** with AI-generated tags, titles, related authors and links, and a description.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin/right_click_menu.png)

You can save code snippets by right-clicking a selection of code and choosing the `Save Current Selection to Pieces` option from the pop-up window.

Alternatively, right-click and hover over the `Pieces` item to access several other snippet-related functions.

Other material management actions available in this menu include:
