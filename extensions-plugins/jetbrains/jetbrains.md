The Pieces for JetBrains plugin provides developers with two pillars of functionality:

Pieces Copilot offers AI-assisted features like starting contextualized generative AI conversations, adding code comments, and troubleshooting code.



Pieces Drive enables you to save, edit, search, and share useful code snippets to boost your workflow productivity and streamline collaboration with others.

These features let developers store their favorite code in a personal, easy-to-access library. They can quickly review past work, find related authors and links with the extra details saved with each piece, and more.



## Using Pieces Copilot

You can perform several decisive actions with the Pieces Copilot inside of your JetBrains IDE, like starting a conversation directly inside the editor with your LLM of choice about a specific code snippet, fragment, folder, or terminal output.

The Ask Copilot feature is the backbone of the Pieces Copilot experience.

Pieces for Developers recently rolled out its new AI Quick Actions feature—similar to VS Code’s Codelens—which allows for select quick actions powered by Pieces Copilot, namely Pieces: Explain and Pieces: Comment.

The Quick Action tools—Pieces: Explain and Pieces: Comment—are above the function nearest to your cursor.

Using either AI Quick Actions triggers the Pieces Copilot conversation window, where you can find the output from the LLM of your choice.

These AI Quick Action tools live above certain pieces of code, like functions, so you always have easy access to them.



## Managing Code Snippets

When you save code to your personal repository, Pieces automatically enriches the snippet with AI-generated tags, titles, related authors and links, and a description.



You can save code snippets by right-clicking a selection of code and choosing the Save Current Selection to Pieces option from the pop-up window.

Alternatively, right-click and hover over the Pieces item to access several other snippet-related functions.

Other material management actions available in this menu include:
