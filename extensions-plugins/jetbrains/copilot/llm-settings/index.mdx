## Switching LLMs

Currently, the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin supports over 54 different cloud and local models, [which you can find here.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/large-language-models)

## How to Switch Models

To get started, open the Pieces Copilot chat in the side-window using any of the available methods, such as opening a Copilot Chat with an option in the tool menu, using a quick action, selecting the Pieces icon from the sidebar, and other means.

To access the LLM menu within the Copilot Chat:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Copilot Chat">
    Open the Copilot Chat view by clicking the **sidebar icon**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Active Model">
    Look for the **active model** in the lower-left of the Copilot Chat view

  </Step>

  <Step title="Change Active Model">
    Click the active model icon and select your preferred LLM from the menu
  </Step>
</Steps>

The Pieces Copilot will utilize that model for all AI-related featuresâ€”no restart or refresh needed.

Depending on your preferences and intended workflow, you can choose between cloud-hosted and local models.

<Callout type="tip">
  Using local models allows for the flexibility to work in a completely offline environment without sacrificing Pieces Copilot.
