# Supported LLMs

We update and configure our plugins and extensions, like the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, to work with the latest LLMs.

## Switching LLMs

Currently, the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin supports over 54 different cloud and local models, which you can find here.

## How to Switch Models

To get started, open the Pieces Copilot chat in the side-window using any of the available methods, such as opening a Copilot Chat with an option in the tool menu, using a quick action, selecting the Pieces icon from the sidebar, and other means.

To access the LLM menu within the Copilot Chat:

Open the Copilot Chat view by clicking the sidebar icon

Look for the active model in the lower-left of the Copilot Chat view



Click the active model icon and select your preferred LLM from the menu

The Pieces Copilot will utilize that model for all AI-related featuresâ€”no restart or refresh needed.

Depending on your preferences and intended workflow, you can choose between cloud-hosted and local models.



Using local models allows for the flexibility to work in a completely offline environment without sacrificing Pieces Copilot.
