# Code Comments

Adding comments to your code is crucial in Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, especially for shared codebases with other developers.

## Commenting Code Selections with Pieces Copilot

Pieces Copilot can analyze and comment on any selected portion of your code, explaining its logic line by line. This ensures your code is readable and easy for others to understand.

To add comments to your code from the toolbar, select the desired lines, right-click, hover over Pieces, and choose Comment Selection with Copilot.



Pieces Copilot generates clear, contextual comments for the selected code in the Copilot chat window. Click Insert at Cursor to add the comments at your cursor's location. You can also click Accept Changes to insert the comments directly between the lines of code where you selected the code.



A faster way to add documentation to a function you might have missed is to click the Pieces: Comment tool. This tool appears above actionable functions in your code that are visible on your screen.

This new AI Quick Actions feature, like CodeLens actions that appear above functions near your cursor, can quickly generate comments to explain the purpose and logic of your code.

To get started, look for the AI Quick Actions buttons above individual functions in your code.

Once you find the AI Quick Actions, left-click on Pieces: Comment, then click Accept Changes to add the new comments directly into your code.



## Why Use Code Comments?

Code comments are crucial for keeping a clean, well-documented codebase. They give context for reviewers to focus on functionality and make complex reasoning clear, making the code easier to follow and maintain.

Good documentation boosts code readability and speeds up onboarding for those new to the codebase. This benefits both current and future development and lays a strong foundation for upgrades and iterations.

Comments help you remember the purpose and function of the code, making it easier to understand after a break.

This feature is powerful. Need to document a few hundred lines of code? Just use Comment Selection with Copilot.
