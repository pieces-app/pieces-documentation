# Fixing Errors with Pieces Copilot

You can easily debug and fix errors with the built-in Pieces: Copilot Fix feature in the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin.

## Using the Debugging Tool

To start debugging, locate your project's error or problematic code segment.

Errors are usually indicated by red underscoring surrounding the error or problematic lines of code.

Then, click the Yellow Lightbulb to the left of the buggy code, and click Pieces: Copilot Fix.



Pieces Copilot will utilize whichever LLM you have currently active and analyze the issue. Then, it will open a Copilot Chat with suggestions, regenerate the code, and provide the option to insert it at the cursor mark—all with fresh code comments.

## Why Debug with Pieces Copilot?

Debugging with Pieces Copilot makes fixing errors easier and gives you AI-driven insights without interrupting your workflow in JetBrains.

This saves time by eliminating the need to search for solutions online or sift through extensive documentation, keeping your workflow efficient and minimizing distractions.

Additionally, each suggested fix has an explanation to help you understand and improve your coding practices while debugging.

The Pieces Copilot proactively identifies code issues—highlight your code, click the Yellow Lightbulb, and let it analyze the problem(s).
