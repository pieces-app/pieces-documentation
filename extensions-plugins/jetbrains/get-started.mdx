## JetBrains Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **PiecesOS:** The core engine that powers all Pieces extensions. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os">Learn more about PiecesOS.</a>
- **Any JetBrains IDE:** The <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> works with any of the official JetBrains IDEs, so make sure you've got one installed.

You must have <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os">PiecesOS</a> to use the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin. We also recommend downloading the Pieces for Developers Desktop App.

## Installing the Pieces for JetBrains Plugin

You can install the Pieces for JetBrains plugin through the <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets">JetBrains Marketplace</a> or by searching for Pieces in the plugins search of your IDE.

Once you've installed the plugin, you can use Pieces without restarting your IDE.

### Setting up PiecesOS

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pieces.app/products/core-dependencies/pieces-os">PiecesOS</a> is required for the <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> to work.

If you haven't installed it yet, click the buttons to download PiecesOS via the recommended method, or follow the alternative steps below.

<get-started-install />

<alert>
  For enhanced security and better system integration, we recommend installing the `appinstaller` package over the InnoSetup (.exe) installer. The `appinstaller` package operates in a containerized environment, providing additional security benefits.

## Updating

The <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> will automatically update when a new version is available.
