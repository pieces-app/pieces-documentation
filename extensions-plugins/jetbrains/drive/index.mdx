## Using Pieces Drive in JetBrains

With the <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a>, you can save all kinds of code snippets and easily find [them](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) whenever, wherever, and however you need.

Let’s take a look at some examples:

***

| `SQL Query Templates`        | An SQL query to retrieve data from a database with filter conditions.                         | Save time with databases by reusing common queries like inserts, updates, or data retrieval.                |

## Streamlining Development with Snippet Management

The <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a> connects you with your development environment, allowing you to focus on what matters—building great software—while empowering you with tools for efficient code reuse.

* **Improved Productivity:** Focus on solving new problems rather than resolving old ones.

* **Contextual Awareness:** Snippets enriched with metadata, descriptions, and links to relevant searches help you remember each piece of code's origin, purpose, and ideal usage scenarios.

* **Code Standardization:** Sharing best practices and reusable components helps developers ensure uniform coding practices and conventions are available across different teams and projects.

By using the <a target="_blank" href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces">Pieces for JetBrains Plugin</a>, you can capture and manage these snippets to streamline daily tasks and enhance your workflow in several ways:

### Save & Organize

Users can save snippets by highlighting the desired code, right-clicking, and selecting the `Save to Pieces` option.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/save_to_pieces.gif" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

You can also do this without opening the right-click menu—use the `⌥+⌘+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux) shortcut while your code is highlighted.

This guarantees that essential pieces of code, such as code fragments, functions, configuration files, and command-line instructions, are always at hand when needed.

Additionally, [each snippet is enriched with context](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#what-happens-when-you-save-a-snippet), enabling you to insert well-documented, relevant snippets where they make sense within your projects.

<Image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/hashnode_product_documentation_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/jetbrains_plugin_assets/using_snippets/MAIN_using_snippets/snippet_enrichment.png" alt="" align="center" fullwidth="true" />

Pieces can also intelligently identify and save snippets based on re-use patterns in your JetBrains workflow.

Whenever Pieces saves a snippet, you'll see a confirmation in the bottom right corner of your screen that says `Snippet Successfully Saved to Pieces`.

Your snippet is now saved in Pieces Drive with auto-generated metadata!

### Search & Reuse

You can [search your entire collection of saved Pieces code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/search-reuse) inside of your preferred JetBrains IDE, so the code you need is always on hand.

To do this, open the **Search Everywhere** window and switch to the `Pieces` tab by using `⌘+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Windows/Linux).

Enter a search query, and any related snippets will appear in the dropdown list—then you can hit enter and view your snippet (with all of its saved context) rendered in markdown directly inside your editor.

### Edit & Update

You can easily [edit and update code snippets](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/edit-update#how-to-edit-snippets) directly from your IDE without opening a separate window or navigating to the Pieces for Developers Desktop App.

To do so, open the **Pieces** from the tool window on the left-hand side of your JetBrains IDE, revealing a list of saved snippets. You can then right-click a snippet, which opens that snippet up in a new window.

Make changes and save the snippet using `⌘+s` (macOS) or `ctrl+s` (Windows/Linux).

### Sharing

The **Sharing Snippets** feature allows you to [share code snippets with your team](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/sharing) or across projects directly from your JetBrains IDE.

To share a snippet, right-click on some highlighted code, hover over the Pieces option, and select `Share via Pieces Link`.

You can also share a snippet by right-clicking a snippet that’s listed in the left-hand toolbar window in any of your JetBrains IDEs and clicking `Share via Pieces Link`**.**

## Use Cases

With Pieces for JetBrains Plugin, your snippets become a robust library of reusable code that you can organize, search, edit, and share across projects.

Here are some examples of how you can use them:

### Reusable Scheduling Functions

Imagine you’re frequently working on projects that involve scheduling tasks at regular intervals.

Instead of rewriting the same logic for each new project, you can [save an evergreen snippet to your Pieces repository.](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets)

This allows you to reuse a well-crafted scheduling function across multiple applications, that is useful in a variety of scenarios:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// A reusable function to schedule tasks at a specified interval
func scheduleTask(interval time.Duration, task func()) {
	ticker := time.NewTicker(interval)
	defer ticker.Stop()

	for {
		select {
		case <-ticker.C:
			task()
		}
	}
}
```

### File System Monitoring

Suppose you frequently work on projects that involve monitoring file system changes. In that case, you can [save a helpful snippet to your Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/extensions-plugins/jetbrains/drive/save-snippets#saving-snippets) that does precisely that, using generic and reusable naming conventions:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify"
)

// A reusable function to monitor file system changes
func watchFileChanges(path string) {
	watcher, err := fsnotify.NewWatcher()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer watcher.Close()

	err = watcher.Add(path)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for {
		select {
		case event := <-watcher.Events:
			if event.Op&fsnotify.Write == fsnotify.Write {
				fmt.Println("Modified file:", event.Name)
			}
		case err := <-watcher.Errors:
			fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		}
	}
}
```
