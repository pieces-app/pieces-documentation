Let's answer a few basic questions: 

### What is Pieces?

At its core, Pieces is an all-in-one productivity tool that helps developers work _smarter_, not harder, by anchoring engineers to their workflow with the power of the **Long-Term Memory Engine, Pieces Drive,** and the **Pieces Copilot.**

There are **[3]** core pillars of Pieces functionality:

1. [Long-Term Memory Engine (LTM-2)](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#ltm-2): A powerful, AI-powered live context framework that understands what you're working on across your entire development workflow. The LTM-2 helps by outsourcing the burden of memory and retrieval from the developer to AI to maximize space for creativity driven by human intent.
2. [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive): The ability to save, search, reference, reuse, and share small developer resources like code snippets, screenshots, links, and text notes.
3. [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-copilot): An intelligent assistant that helps with generating code, answering questions, and adding code comments while utilizing a LLM of your choiceâ€”featuring an adjustable context window ranging from conversation-only to entire project repositories.

### Who is Pieces For?

To put it simply, Pieces is built from the ground up for developers who frequently reference or reuse small developer materials like code snippets or are looking to pick up where they left off and preserve the context of their workflow.

Pieces is an **excellent productivity option for developers of all levels** and across various fields, including front-end developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and students.

If you find yourself â€¦

1. **Preserving Workflow Context:** If you're wondering where you left off with trying to untangle that permissions mess in Google Cloud Console or Firestore database, the [LTM-2](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#ltm-2) is an invaluable resource that can provide deep-links and anchors in the form of URLs and other helpful context.
2. **Managing Developer Materials**: If you find yourself needing to repurpose or refresh your memory with small developer resources throughout your workflow, the [Pieces Drive](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-drive) can help you stay organized while providing an efficient pipeline for referencing and reusing them.
3. **Needing Code Assistance:** Stuck on a bug, or don't know how to solve a complex algorithmic efficiency problem? Can't center that `div`? Ask [Pieces Copilot](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/fundamentals#pieces-copilot) to help you understand your function, script, code file or entire project and generate code to insert directly into your active file.

â€¦ then Pieces is intelligently designed with _you,_ the developer, in mind.

Let Pieces do the heavy lifting and preserve your engineering creativity and ingenuity for where you need it most.

### How do I Use Pieces?

PiecesOS serves as the foundational layer of the entire Pieces for Developers Suite, much like Docker does for containerized applicationsâ€”it powers the Pieces Desktop App along with all our browser and IDE extensions and plugins.

By installing PiecesOS, you enable the full functionality of the desktop app and our extensions, just like how Docker manages various containers.

We designed it this way to ensure that your dataâ€”including machine learning processes and inter-app communicationsâ€”remains on-device, secure, private, and local.

Click one of the links below to fast-forward to the Pieces Suite installation guide for your operating system:

- [macOS](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/macos-installation-guide)
- [Windows](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/windows-installation-guide)
- [Linux](https://docs.pieces.app/products/meet-pieces/linux-installation-guide)

<Warning>
  PiecesOS is required for any Pieces Software to work, including the Pieces Desktop App.

  However, the Pieces Desktop App is not itself requiredâ€”but it is recommended to install both PiecesOS and the Pieces Desktop App.
